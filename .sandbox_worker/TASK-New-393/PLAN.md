## Objective
Fix Plugin System Tests (T-102.1) to ensure all tests pass and cover all necessary cases.

## Task Description
Fix Plugin System Tests (T-102.1)

## Execution Steps
1. Identify failing test cases in the plugin system tests.
2. Analyze the codebase to understand the root causes of the failures.
3. Modify relevant files to fix bugs or update logic as needed.
4. Write additional test cases to ensure full coverage.
5. Run all tests again to verify that all issues are resolved and new tests pass.

## Files to Modify
- `src/plugins/pluginA.ts`
- `tests/unit/pluginATests.py`

## Dependencies
