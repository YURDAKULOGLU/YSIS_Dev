The analysis involves calculating the time taken by agents to process tasks based on their inbox and outbox timestamps.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Functional Requirements\n1. **Reading Data**: \n   - The script should read timestamp data from the `Inbox` and `Outbox` directories for each agent.\n   \n2. **Processing Data**:\n   - For each agent, extract the earliest inbox timestamp and the latest outbox timestamp.\n   - Calculate the time difference between these two timestamps to determine the processing speed of the agent.\n\n3. **Reporting**:\n   - Output the calculated processing speed (in minutes or any other preferred time unit) for each agent in a readable format.\n   - Optionally, generate additional reports such as average processing speed across all agents.\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n1. **Performance**: \n   - The script should efficiently handle large volumes of timestamp data without significant latency or resource consumption.\n   \n2. **Error Handling**:\n   - Implement error handling to manage scenarios where timestamps are missing or corrupted for an agent.\n\n3. **Scalability**:\n   - Ensure the solution designed supports future enhancements, such as adding additional analysis parameters (e.g., time of day impact).\n\n## Design\n\n### Directory Structure\n- The Python script will be placed in: `20_WORKFORCE/01_Python_Core/Tools`\n\n### Data Input\n- Timestamp data is expected to be in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON) with each record containing agent ID and timestamp.\n\n### Implementation Details\n1. **Modules**:\n   - Use Python’s built-in modules for handling file operations (`os`, `csv`), date calculations (`datetime`), and simple logging (`logging`).\n\n2. **Workflow**:\n   - Read the inbox and outbox data.\n   - Process each record to extract required timestamps.\n   - Compute processing speed using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Processing Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Outbox Timestamp} - \\text{Inbox Timestamp}}{1}\n     \\]\n     Convert and format this value into minutes (if needed).\n   - Output results either into the console, or in a file format (e.g., CSV or JSON).\n\n### Error Handling\n- Log any missing or incomplete data records to facilitate debugging and system improvement.\n  \n### Testing\n- Validate the script using known test data with expected outcomes for processing speed.\n\n## Approval Status\n\n| Requirement | Description                                      | Approved |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n|             ||No|\n\n**Note:** This document is approved subject to further detail refinement as per the project lead's review.\n\n```\n\nAfter generating and saving `SPEC_S004.md`, you would proceed to implement the Python script based on this detailed specification. Ensure that after writing the script, validate its performance against various scenarios to comply with the requirements outlined within the Specifications document.\n\nSince the actual implementation of the Python script is not done here (as it requires further steps), please review the specification and make any necessary adjustments or clarifications before progressing. Once finalized, the implementation phase could be initiated based on this detailed design."
