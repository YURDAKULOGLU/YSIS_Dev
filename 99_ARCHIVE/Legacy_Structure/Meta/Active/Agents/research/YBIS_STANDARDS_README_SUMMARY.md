# Summary: YBIS Project Main Control Center Documentation

This document serves as the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for all YBIS project standards, processes, commands, and overall documentation structure. It is designed to be the primary entry point for understanding "how things are done" within the project.

---

## **1. Operations Standards Handbook**
This section provides modular guides covering key operational aspects:
-   **1.1 Anayasa (Constitution):** Contains fundamental, unchangeable rules of the project. It is emphasized that this document *must be read in every session*.
-   **1.2 Kalite ve Standartlar (Quality and Standards):** Details coding style, linting rules, and TypeScript standards.
-   **1.3 Geliştirme Süreci (Development Process):** Outlines Git flow, branch management, and Pull Request (PR) procedures.
-   **1.4 Test Stratejisi (Test Strategy):** Describes the project's testing philosophy, types of tests, and tools used.
-   **1.5 Teknoloji Yığını (Tech Stack):** Lists all technologies, libraries, and their versions used across the project.

## **2. Agent Awareness Map**
This map acts as a "lazy-loading" guide for AI agents, directing them to relevant documents based on specific task types or keywords (e.g., UI component development, Git operations, testing).

---

## **3. Master Command Index**
A collection of essential and frequently used commands, including `/help`, `/reset`, `/commit`, `/kusbakisi-analiz` (bird's-eye analysis), and `/meta`. It notes that the old `/session start` command is deprecated.

---

## **4. Overall Documentation Map**
Provides quick links to other important documentation areas such such as Quickstart guides, Development Logs, AI Agent Task Distribution, Strategy documents, Vision and Product roadmaps, Reports, Architectural Decisions, and an Archive of inactive documents.

---

## **5. Document Dependency Map**
This map helps maintain homogeneity within the project by showing which other documents might be affected when a specific document is updated. Notably, any changes to the "Anayasa" (Constitution) can impact *all* other project standards and documents.

---

**Current Status:** Version 1.1.0, Active. This document is a critical reference for all project participants, especially AI agents, to ensure consistent and compliant development.
