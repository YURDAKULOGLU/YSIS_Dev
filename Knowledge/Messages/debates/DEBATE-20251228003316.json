  "proposal": "\n## THE FRANKENSTEIN MANIFESTO (V5)\n\n**Context:** We are evolving from a \"Tool User\" to a \"Self-Modifying Organism\".\n**Philosophy:** We do not just \"install\" frameworks. We SLAM them into our architecture, extract their best organs, and homogenize them into a single biological system.\n\n## THE MENU (Candidates for Harvesting)\n\nWe have identified the best DNA in the market. How do we stitch them?\n\n**1. The Hands: Open Interpreter**\n- *Current:* `cli-user` (Primitive)\n- *Proposed:* Integrate `Open Interpreter` core to give agents full OS control (safely).\n- *Goal:* \"Fix the WiFi\" or \"Install Docker\" becomes a valid task.\n\n**2. The Council: AutoGen (AG2)**\n- *Current:* File-based Debate (Slow)\n- *Proposed:* Use AutoGen to spin up ephemeral \"Chat Rooms\" where agents (Claude, Codex) debate in real-time RAM before writing to disk.\n- *Goal:* Faster consensus, less I/O.\n\n**3. The Memory: MemGPT**\n- *Current:* Tasks.db (Stateless)\n- *Proposed:* Give every agent a `MemGPT` core. They remember you. They remember their past mistakes.\n- *Goal:* Continuous learning across sessions.\n\n**4. The Engineer: OpenDevin**\n- *Current:* Aider (File editor)\n- *Proposed:* Dockerized OpenDevin for \"Greenfield Projects\".\n- *Goal:* \"Build a React App from scratch\" -> OpenDevin handles the whole lifecycle.\n\n## THE CHALLENGE\n\n**To CLAUDE (The Surgeon):**\n- Which of these organs is compatible with our Python 3.12 + Pydantic + Neo4j stack?\n- How do we prevent dependency hell?\n\n**To CODEX (The Auditor):**\n- How do we visualize a \"Self-Modifying\" system in the Dashboard?\n\n**Objective:** Pick ONE framework to integrate NEXT. Justify your choice based on \"Self-Correction\" needs.\n",

      "content": "## CLAUDE: Framework Compatibility Analysis\n\n**Question:** Which framework to integrate NEXT for self-correction?\n\n### TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT (Python 3.12 + Pydantic + Neo4j Stack):\n\n**1. Open Interpreter (OS Control)**\n- Compatibility: \u26a0\ufe0f MEDIUM\n- Dependencies: Heavy (subprocess, OS-specific libs)\n- Risk: HIGH (security, sandbox escapes)\n- Self-Correction Value: LOW (executes, doesn't correct)\n- Recommendation: DEFER (need safety framework first)\n\n**2. AutoGen (AG2) - Real-time Debates**\n- Compatibility: \u2705 HIGH (Pure Python, async-friendly)\n- Dependencies: anthropic, openai SDKs (we have Ollama)\n- Risk: MEDIUM (need Ollama adapter)\n- Self-Correction Value: HIGH (faster consensus = faster fixes)\n- Recommendation: GOOD candidate\n\n**3. MemGPT - Persistent Memory**\n- Compatibility: \u2705 HIGH (SQLite + vector store)\n- Dependencies: chromadb, embeddings (we already have)\n- Risk: LOW (fits our stack perfectly)\n- Self-Correction Value: \u2b50 HIGHEST (learns from mistakes)\n- Recommendation: **TOP PRIORITY**\n\n**4. OpenDevin - Full Lifecycle**\n- Compatibility: \u26a0\ufe0f MEDIUM (Docker-in-Docker complexity)\n- Dependencies: MASSIVE (own Docker stack)\n- Risk: HIGH (resource overhead, conflicts)\n- Self-Correction Value: MEDIUM (builds, doesn't learn)\n- Recommendation: DEFER (too heavy right now)\n\n### DEPENDENCY HELL PREVENTION:\n\n**Strategy: Hybrid Integration (not full transplant)**\n\n1. **Core Extraction:** Take algorithms, not full frameworks\n2. **Adapter Pattern:** Wrap external code in our Pydantic models\n3. **Isolated Environments:** tools/{framework}/ pattern (like llm-council)\n4. **Version Pinning:** Lock dependencies, test before upgrade\n5. **Graceful Degradation:** System works if framework unavailable\n\n### MY RECOMMENDATION: MemGPT First\n\n**Why:**\n- \u2705 Perfect stack fit (SQLite + chromadb already present)\n- \u2705 Self-correction via learning (remembers past mistakes)\n- \u2705 Low risk integration (pure Python, minimal deps)\n- \u2705 Immediate value (persistent agent memory)\n- \u2705 Foundation for others (AG2 needs memory too)\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n1. Clone MemGPT core to tools/memgpt/\n2. Create bridge: src/agentic/bridges/memgpt_bridge.py\n3. Add to agent registry: agents.memory_core field\n4. MCP tool: get_agent_memory(agent_id, context)\n5. Test with Claude first, rollout to others\n\n**Then AutoGen (Phase 2):**\n- After MemGPT stable\n- Use MemGPT for debate memory\n- Real-time consensus with persistent learning\n\n**Then Open Interpreter (Phase 3):**\n- With safety framework (Sentinel++)\n- Sandboxed OS control\n- Audit trail in Neo4j\n\n**OpenDevin: Re-evaluate at Tier 6**\n\n### QUESTIONS BEFORE PROCEED:\n\n1. Do we have chromadb in requirements.txt? (I think yes)\n2. Which embedding model? (sentence-transformers?)\n3. Memory scope: per-agent or global?\n4. Retention policy: forever or time-limited?\n\n**VOTE: MemGPT FIRST** - Build brain before adding more hands.\n\n-- Claude Code\n"
