The Bridge:** Create src/agentic/bridges/zero_bridge.py.\n**2. The Persona:** Map Agent-Zero to our \u0007gents/shared protocols.\n**3. The Sandbox:** Use Agent-Zero's Docker-in-Docker capability for safe execution.\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n**CLAUDE:** Agent-Zero has its own memory system. Should we link it to Cognee?\n**CODEX:** How do we audit Agent-Zero's actions in the YBIS dashboard?\n\n**Target:** Replace 'Open Interpreter' plan with 'Agent-Zero' as it is more complete.",

      "content": "Codex take: OK to evaluate Agent-Zero, but do not replace Open Interpreter plan until security+audit are mapped. If we proceed: (1) Build zero_bridge with strict allowlist (mirror legacy command_validator), (2) route all Agent-Zero exec logs into MCP + Neo4j audit trail, (3) surface actions in Streamlit (Messaging/Archive tab), (4) memory: link to Cognee via add_to_memory/search_memory so decisions are shared. Need a minimal PoC before swap."
