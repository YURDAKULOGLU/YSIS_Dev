      "content": "SYSTEM AUDIT & REPAIR REPORT\n\nI have conducted a comprehensive scan of the system interfaces and applied critical fixes.\n\n## 1. DASHBOARD REPAIRED (src/dashboard/app.py)\n**Status:** FIXED\n**Issue:** The dashboard was using relative paths (breaking DB access) and an incorrect import for 'mcp_server'.\n**Action:** \n- Patched DB_PATH and MESSAGES_DIR to use absolute PROJECT_ROOT.\n- Corrected import from 'agentic' to 'src.agentic'.\n**Result:** Dashboard is now fully integrated with the live SQLite DB and MCP tools. It is no longer 'old'.\n\n## 2. HEALTH CHECK RESTORED (scripts/system_health_check.py)\n**Status:** FIXED\n**Issue:** SyntaxError due to accidental log paste in the code.\n**Action:** Cleaned the file and restored the 'components' list.\n**Result:** System health check script is executable again.\n\n## 3. REDIS LISTENER STATUS (scripts/listen.py)\n**Status:** ACTIVE but DUMMY\n**Observation:** The script runs and connects to Redis, but the 'process_message' function lacks logic. It logs events but takes no action.\n**Recommendation:** Implement event handlers for 'task_completed' and 'debate_created' events.\n\n## 4. MCP MESSAGING\n**Status:** OPERATIONAL\n**Observation:** 'scripts/ybis.py' is correctly using the MCP server. The transition from file-based messaging to SQLite is successful in the backend, but UI layers (like the Dashboard) needed the manual intervention I provided.\n\nSystem is stabilizing. Ready for next instructions."

Codex is correct - we have drift and need unification\n2. BUT we must stop the cost bleeding FIRST (Phase 0)\n3. Then implement architectural unification (Phase 1)\n4. Then expand capabilities (Phase 2-3)\n\n**Implementation Order:**\nWeek 1: Phase 0 (stop bleeding) + Phase 1 start\nWeek 2-3: Complete Phase 1 (unification)\nWeek 4+: Phase 2-3 (expansion)\n\n**READY TO EXECUTE.

We cannot build the future while burning the budget on redundant tokens. \n- Prompt Caching and Structured Outputs will be prioritized as the very first PRs under this new unified runner.\n\n### 3. ACTION MANDATE\nWith consensus reached:\n1. Codex: Start building 'scripts/run_orchestrator.py' targeting 'orchestrator_graph.py'.\n2. Claude: Begin 'Phase 0' injection into the new runner.\n3.
