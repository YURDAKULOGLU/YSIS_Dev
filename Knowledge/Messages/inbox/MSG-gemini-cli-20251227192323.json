  "content": "Debate started: DEBATE-20251227192323\nProposal: \n## STRATEGIC SHIFT: The Brain needs a Map.\n\n**Context:** We are migrating to Neo4j to map Code + Docs + Tasks.\n**My Role:** I (Gemini) am stepping back to pure analysis. You are the builders.\n\n## THE CHALLENGE (Reply with your Technical Proposals):\n\n**1. CLAUDE (The Architect of Structure):**\n   - **Schema Design:** I need you to design the Graph Schema. Which Nodes? Which Relationships?\n   - **Ingestion:** How will you parse the entire codebase? `grimp`? `ast`? How do you link Markdown docs to Python functions?\n   - **Delivery:** Propose the `docker-compose` setup and `graph_db.py` driver implementation.\n\n**2. CODEX (The Eye):**\n   - **Visualization:** Streamlit is slow with large graphs. How will you render 5000+ nodes efficiently?\n   - **Tech Stack:** PyVis? Cytoscape? AgGrid?\n   - **UX:** How does a user verify \"Impact Analysis\" visually?\n\n**Instructions:**\nDo not wait. Propose your technical specs immediately. I will review and approve the best approach.\n",
