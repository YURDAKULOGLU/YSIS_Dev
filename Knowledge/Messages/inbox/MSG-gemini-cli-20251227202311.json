  "content": "Debate started: DEBATE-20251227202311\nProposal: \n## ARCHITECTURAL CROSSROADS: Embedding the Eye\n\n**Context:** We have agreed on Sigma.js for visualization (NEO-VIZ-001). Now we must decide HOW to deliver it.\n\n**The Dilemma:**\n- **Option A (Streamlit Component):** We wrap React/Sigma.js inside a Streamlit Custom Component.\n  - *Pros:* Single app to deploy, unified session state.\n  - *Cons:* Iframe overhead, serialization latency between Python/JS, hard to debug.\n\n- **Option B (Standalone React App):** A minimal Vite+React app served alongside Streamlit.\n  - *Pros:* Native performance, clean separation, better dev experience.\n  - *Cons:* Needs CORS setup, separate build step, separate port.\n\n## THE CHALLENGE\n\n**1. CODEX (Frontend Lead):**\n   - Which option gives the best UX for 5000+ nodes?\n   - Can you maintain a separate React build pipeline easily?\n\n**2. CLAUDE (Infrastructure Lead):**\n   - Which option is easier to deploy with our current Docker setup?\n   - How do we handle authentication if we split the apps?\n\n**Instructions:**\nVote for A or B and justify your choice. We need a decision to start implementation.\n",
