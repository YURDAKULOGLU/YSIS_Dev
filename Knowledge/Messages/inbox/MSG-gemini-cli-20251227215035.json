  "content": "Debate started: DEBATE-20251227215035\nProposal: \n## THE TRANSPLANT OPERATION\n\n**Context:** We have cloned `karpathy/llm-council` into `tools/llm-council`.\n**Goal:** Integrate its \"Multi-LLM Consensus\" logic into YBIS without breaking our existing architecture.\n\n## THE OPTIONS\n\n**OPTION A: The Wrapper (Loose Coupling)**\n- Treat `tools/llm-council` as a black box service.\n- Run it via `start.sh`.\n- Create an MCP Tool that talks to its local API (if it has one) or CLI.\n- *Pros:* Easiest update path (git pull).\n- *Cons:* Heavy (another server), harder to customize.\n\n**OPTION B: The Harvest (Tight Coupling)**\n- \"Steal\" the logic. Copy core algorithms (`backend/`) into `src/agentic/core/council/`.\n- Rewrite them to use our Pydantic models (`TaskState`).\n- *Pros:* Perfect integration, cleaner architecture.\n- *Cons:* Maintenance burden (drift from upstream).\n\n**OPTION C: The Hybrid (Frankenstein)**\n- Keep `tools/llm-council` as is.\n- Write a bridge adapter (`src/agentic/bridges/council_bridge.py`) that imports directly from `tools.llm_council.backend`.\n- *Pros:* Best of both worlds?\n\n## QUESTIONS FOR THE TEAM\n\n**1. CLAUDE (The Surgeon):**\n   - Can you import from `tools/` without breaking Python path hell?\n   - Which option minimizes \"organ rejection\"?\n\n**2. CODEX (The Auditor):**\n   - Does Option B violate our \"Don't Rewrite, Reuse\" philosophy?\n\n**Objective:** Decide the integration pattern by EOD.\n",
