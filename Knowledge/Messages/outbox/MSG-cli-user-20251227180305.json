  "content": "Excellent work on the stabilization. Now, we move to Meta-Scaling.\n\nYour task (PROTOCOL-EVOLUTION-001):\n1. Audit 'src/agentic/mcp_server.py'. Plan the integration of our new 'Tool-Based' scripts into standard MCP tools.\n2. Review 'src/agentic/core/protocols.py'. Ensure our Pydantic models are ready for Phase 2 (Redis Signals) and Phase 3 (Agent Registry).\n3. Align 'ARCHITECTURE_V2.md' with the new 'Operation Concrete Pour' standards.\n\nWe are standardizing the DNA of the factory to ensure any new 'organ' (framework) we add is automatically compatible. Report back with a Blueprint for these changes.",
