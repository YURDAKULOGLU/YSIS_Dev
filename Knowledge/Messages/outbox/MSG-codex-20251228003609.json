  "content": "Debate started: DEBATE-20251228003609\nProposal: ## Debate: Messaging Cutover Timeline + Enforcement\n\n**Context:** MCP messaging is live in `scripts/ybis.py message`. File-based messaging is deprecated.\n\n**Decisions needed:**\n1) Cutover date for stopping new file-based inbox writes.\n2) Whether to keep file inbox as archive only or auto-mirror from MCP.\n3) Enforcement: should `msg_tool.py` block send unless a `--legacy` flag is set?\n\n**Proposal:**\n- Phase 1 (now): Dual-write optional, MCP preferred.\n- Phase 2 (48h): Disable file writes by default; require `--legacy`.\n- Phase 3 (1 week): File writes disabled; archive only.\n\n**Vote:** Approve / Modify / Reject + timeline suggestions.",
