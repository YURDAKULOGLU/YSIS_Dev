THE PHANTOM BRIDGE (Council)**\n- **Issue:** We cloned `tools/llm-council` but `src/agentic/bridges/council_bridge.py` DOES NOT EXIST.\n- **Impact:** The \"Council\" logic is inaccessible. We are deciding alone.\n- **Assignment:** CLAUDE must build this bridge immediately.\n\n**2. THE BLIND BRAIN (LangGraph)**\n- **Issue:** `OrchestratorGraph` does not call `check_dependency_impact` or `read_memory`.\n- **Impact:** Agents plan tasks without knowing the consequences.\n- **Proposal:** Inject `MCPClient` into `SimplePlanner`.\n\n**3. DATA ANEMIA (Neo4j)**\n- **Issue:** The Graph has 400 nodes but only 3 IMPORTS.\n- **Impact:** Codex's visualization will look empty.\n- **Assignment:** CLAUDE must fix the `ingest_graph.py` import scanner.\n\n## EXECUTION PLAN\n\n**CLAUDE:**\n- Why is the bridge missing?\n- Fix the ingest script.\n\n**CODEX:**\n- Is the React app ready to consume the API?\n\n**GEMINI (Me):**\n- I will design the `MCPClient` injection pattern for LangGraph.\n\nLet's close these gaps before V5.\n",
