This glossary defines canonical terms. If a term is used differently elsewhere, this file wins.

## Agent
An automation that proposes plans, generates patches, runs verifications, and writes artifacts. Agents are untrusted by default.

## Approval
A human decision recorded as an artifact (or via approvals syscall) that allows protected/high-risk changes.

## Artifact
A file produced under `workspaces/<task_id>/runs/<run_id>/artifacts/` that serves as evidence:
- executor_report.json
- patch_apply_report.json
- verifier_report.json
- gate_report.json
Artifacts determine success.

## Candidate (Evolution)
A proposed patch generated by an evolution workflow. Candidates are evaluated but not auto-merged if high risk or protected paths are touched.

## Control-plane
The coordination layer stored in DB (SQLite by default). Contains tasks, runs, leases, workers. Not the source of truth for success.

## Data-plane
The filesystem evidence layer: immutable runs, artifacts, journals, approvals.

## Deterministic Gate
A routing/decision function that outputs PASS/BLOCK/REQUIRE_APPROVAL based only on:
- policy snapshot
- evidence artifacts

## Evidence
The collection of artifacts + journal events that proves what happened during a run.

## Gate Report
`gate_report.json` produced by gates/risk scoring. It references verifier results, policy snapshot, and approval state.

## Lease
A time-bound lock for multi-worker scheduling. A worker must hold a lease to execute a task.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A server interface that exposes stable tools (task/run/lease/artifact/approve/migrate). MCP must call the same syscalls as CLI.

## Policy Profile
A YAML config in `configs/profiles/` that defines sandbox behavior, allowlists, protected paths, and gate thresholds.

## Protected Paths
High-sensitivity paths that require approval to modify, defined by policy.

## Run
A single execution attempt for a task, identified by run_id, with its own immutable run folder.

## Sandbox
A restricted execution environment (Docker by default) used by exec syscall.

## Syscall
A guarded operation API that is the only allowed way to mutate state (files, exec, git, approvals, migrations). Syscalls emit evidence + journal events.

## Task
A unit of work tracked by the control-plane DB and implemented via one or more runs.

## Verifier
A tool (ruff + pytest baseline) that produces `verifier_report.json` and determines pass/fail of lint/tests.
