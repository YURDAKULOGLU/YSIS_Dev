# PLAN.md (Canonical)

References:
- WORKFLOWS.md
- INTERFACES.md

Purpose:
This is the canonical description of PLAN artifacts. Per-run plans live in
`workspaces/<task_id>/runs/<run_id>/docs/PLAN.md`.

Notes:
- Plans are derived from specs and list files, steps, and risks.
- Plans must align with the spec and be validated by the spec compliance gate.
