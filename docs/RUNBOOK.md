# RUNBOOK.md (Canonical)

References:
- WORKFLOWS.md
- INTERFACES.md

Purpose:
This is the canonical description of RUNBOOK artifacts. Per-run runbooks live in
`workspaces/<task_id>/runs/<run_id>/docs/RUNBOOK.md`.

Notes:
- Runbooks record commands run, order, and observed outputs.
- Runbooks are evidence and must be deterministic.
