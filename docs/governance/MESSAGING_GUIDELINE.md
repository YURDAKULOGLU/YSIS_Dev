# Messaging Guideline (Quiet Agent)
> Standard v1.0
> Goal: Reduce filler and keep task communication compact.

## Rules
- Messages must be task-relevant and concise (no greetings or praise).
- Include the task id in the subject when applicable.
- Prefer bullet summaries and avoid repeating artifact content.
- Use evidence links or file paths instead of pasted logs.

## Minimum Structure (recommended)
- Subject: "Task Update: TASK-XXXX"
- Content:
  - Status: <IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | DONE>
  - Change: <what changed in one line>
  - Verify: <tests run or manual check>
  - Next: <next action or request>
