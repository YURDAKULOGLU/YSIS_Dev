# YBIS Platform

> **Agentic Development Platform** - Self-Bootstrapping, Zero Reinvention

YBIS is an agentic development platform that uses itself to evolve itself. Built on LangGraph workflows, evidence-based gates, and comprehensive observability.

## Core Principles

### 1. Self-Bootstrapping ("Dog Scales Dog")
The system MUST use itself to develop itself. Every feature added to YBIS should accelerate YBIS development.

### 2. Zero Reinvention ("Vendor First")
If a SOTA solution exists, ADAPT it. NEVER rebuild it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run a task
python scripts/ybis_run.py TASK-123

# Start worker
python scripts/ybis_worker.py
```
