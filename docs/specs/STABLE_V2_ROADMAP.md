## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Transform YBIS from a self-modifying system into a **Universal Project Factory**.
"One prompt, one project, one deploy."

## 🚀 PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & MODERNIZATION (Week 1)
*Goal: Bridge infrastructure gaps and catch up to 2025 standards.*

1.  **Unified Messaging Mesh (P0):**
    - Complete the migration of Debates to SQLite.
2.  **MCP Server Modernization (P0):**
    - Update MCP SDK to 2025-11-25 Specification (Async support).
    - **Prompt Caching:** Activate ephemeral caching to reduce costs by 90%.
3.  **Extended Thinking & Structured Outputs (P0):**
    - Enable Claude's 'Extended Thinking' in `SimplePlanner` for decision transparency.
    - Enforce Pydantic Structured Outputs across all agent interactions to eliminate JSON parsing errors.
4.  **Async Subagent Mesh (P1):**
    - Implement asynchronous background agent calling for 20-30% speed boost.

## 🏗️ PHASE 2: THE UNIVERSAL PROJECT BUILDER (Week 2)
*Goal: Building external structures with strict discipline.*

1.  **ProjectScaffolder Engine:**
    - Create a core class using `Aider` + `Bolt.diy` patterns.
2.  **The Integration Contract (Codex Mandate):**
    - Every new module MUST ship with a 1-page `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md`.
3.  **Multi-Modal Video Ingestion (P1):**
    - Integrate **Gemini 3 Pro** API to support "Watch Video -> Build App" workflows.

## 🧪 PHASE 3: AUTONOMOUS TEST & DEPLOY (Week 3)
*Goal: Verification and Delivery.*

1.  **DeploymentManager:**
    - Automated deployment to Vercel/Railway via MCP.
2.  **Auto-Test Generator:**
    - System must generate Pytest/Jest suites for the external project.
3.  **Neo4j Impact Analysis:**
    - Use the graph to ensure new projects don't conflict with local resources.
