# SPEC.md: Exponential Backoff Documentation File

## Requirements

The following requirements need to be met:

- Create a markdown-based documentation file named `RETRY_LOGIC.md` located at the path `docs/RETRY_LOGIC.md`.
- The document should provide a clear explanation of how exponential backoff is implemented in this project.
- Include any necessary diagrams or illustrations to aid understanding.

## Rationale

The implementation of exponential backoff is crucial for preventing overloading of services during periods of high traffic, ensuring that our system remains responsive and efficient. By documenting this feature, we ensure that future developers can quickly understand how it works and implement it effectively in their own work.

## Technical Approach

- The `RETRY_LOGIC.md` file will be created using Markdown syntax for readability.
- Diagrams or illustrations may be included to aid understanding of the exponential backoff mechanism.
- Code examples will be provided where necessary to illustrate key concepts.

## Data Models and API Signatures

This task does not require any specific data models or API signatures. However, we can include a section on relevant classes or functions in our codebase that are involved in implementing exponential backoff.

## Constraints and Considerations

- The documentation should be accessible from within the project.
- It must be readable by both technical and non-technical users.
- Any diagrams or illustrations should be clear and concise.

## Technical Specifications

### Documentation File Requirements

#### `RETRY_LOGIC.md`

*   Exponential Backoff: A mechanism used to prevent overloading of services during periods of high traffic
*   Definition: The algorithm increases the delay between attempts, starting with a base delay and then multiplying it by two with each attempt until a maximum limit is reached.
*   Purpose: To ensure our system remains responsive and efficient under varying loads.

### Diagrams and Illustrations

A simple illustration that shows how exponential backoff works will be included to aid understanding:

|             |               |
|-------------|---------------|
| Initial     |  Base Delay   |
| Attempt     |  *2*          |
| Attempt N   |  *2\*\*(N-1)\* |  |
| Max Attempts|  Maximum Limit|

This diagram illustrates the exponential backoff mechanism, showing how the delay between attempts increases with each attempt.

### Code Examples

A code snippet that demonstrates the implementation of exponential backoff in our project will be included to further illustrate key concepts.
