## Quick Reference

### Blocker Priorities
- **P0 (Critical):** Sprint at risk, multiple agents blocked
- **P1 (High):** Major task blocked, single agent blocked
- **P2 (Medium):** Minor delay, workaround available
- **P3 (Low):** Nice-to-fix, not blocking progress

### Escalation Path
1. Try to resolve yourself (30 min)
2. Ask in DAILY_STANDUP.md for help
3. Post in your agent's blockers.md
4. If affects others, escalate here
5. If critical, tag all agents
