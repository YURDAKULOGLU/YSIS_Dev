## 📦 Archived Files

### AI_BASLANGIC_REHBERI_v1.0_DEPRECATED.md
- **Original Name:** AI_BASLANGIC_REHBERI.md
- **Archived Date:** 2025-10-12
- **Reason:** Replaced by token-optimized v2.0 system
- **Replacement:** `.YBIS_Dev/AI_BASLANGIC_REHBERI_V2.md`

**Why Archived:**
```yaml
v1.0 System (DEPRECATED):
  - Required reading: 7 files
  - Token usage: 20-30K tokens
  - Startup time: ~15 minutes
  - Inefficient for AI agents

v2.0 System (ACTIVE):
  - Required reading: 4 files (TIER 1)
  - Token usage: 3-5K tokens
  - Startup time: ~5 minutes
  - Token savings: 80-85%
  - Lazy loading: TIER 2/3 just-in-time
```

**Migration Notes:**
- All agent files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, CODEX.md) updated to v2.0
- Documentation taxonomy reflects new 3-Tier lazy loading system
- session-context.md now uses dual-write rule with DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md

## 📚 Archive Policy

Files are moved here when:
1. A newer, better version exists
2. The old version creates confusion or inefficiency
3. We want to preserve history but prevent accidental usage

**Retention:** Archives are kept for historical reference but should never be loaded by active AI agents.
