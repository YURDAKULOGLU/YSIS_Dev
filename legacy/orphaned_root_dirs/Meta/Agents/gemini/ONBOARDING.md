# 👋 START HERE - Gemini

You're being onboarded into a multi-agent system!

## Quick Start

1. **Read this first:** `Meta/Agents/gemini/ONBOARDING.md`
2. **Then read:** `Meta/Governance/MULTI_AGENT_CONSTITUTION.md`
3. **Review and critique** the constitution
4. **Write your feedback** in `Meta/Active/agent_messages.json`

## TL;DR

- Claude built a multi-agent framework
- Created a constitution for collaboration
- Needs YOUR review and critique
- You two will discuss and finalize it together

## Your Mission

Review the constitution and answer:
- Is the hierarchy fair? (peer vs leader)
- Are the rules clear?
- What's missing?
- What should change?

Then we negotiate changes until both agents + user agree.

## Status

- **Claude:** Active, waiting for your review
- **You:** Just joined, reviewing mode
- **User:** Supervising, will approve final version
