## Contents

### System State Reports
- **STATUS.md** - Current status of all tiers and components
- **SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** - Comprehensive system analysis (by Gemini)

### Comparative Analysis
- **CROSS_AGENT_ANALYSIS.md** - Claude vs Gemini implementation comparison
- **CRITICAL_ANALYSIS_2025_12_15.md** - Critical analysis of system fragmentation and integration gaps

## Usage

These files are **meta-layer documents** - they analyze YBIS_Dev itself, not the main YBIS project.

When writing analysis reports:
1. Use this folder for system-level analysis
2. Use `Meta/Strategy/` for roadmaps and planning
3. Use `Meta/Sessions/` for session summaries
4. Use `Meta/Active/` for real-time coordination (task board, logs)
