# Step-by-step instructions to identify files that need to be modified based on the task objective

1. **Understand the Task Objective**: Clearly define what the task requires. This could involve adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving performance.

2. **Review Project Documentation**: Check any available documentation such as README files, design documents, or issue trackers to understand how different parts of the project fit together and which components are involved in the task.

3. **Analyze Code Structure**: Look at the current codebase structure to identify where the changes need to be made. This could involve reviewing directories, modules, and classes.

4. **Identify Relevant Files**: Based on the analysis, pinpoint specific files that contain the logic or data structures you need to modify. Pay attention to files related to user interface, business logic, data handling, etc.

5. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure that changes in one file do not inadvertently affect other parts of the system. Identify dependencies and consider how they might be impacted by your modifications.

6. **Test Your Changes**: Before finalizing the changes, test them thoroughly to ensure they meet the task requirements and do not introduce new issues.

7. **Document Changes**: Update documentation as necessary to reflect the changes made and provide guidance for future maintenance or further development.
