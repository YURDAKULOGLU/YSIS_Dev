# Griptape Integration

If you're familiar with Griptape's RAG Engine and want to start evaluating your RAG system's performance, you're in the right place. In this tutorial we'll explore how to use Ragas to evaluate the responses generated by your Griptape RAG Engine.

## Griptape Setup

### Setting Up Our Environment

First, let's make sure we have all the required packages installed:

```
%pip install "griptape[all]" ragas -q
```

### Creating Our Dataset

We'll use a small dataset of text chunks about major LLM providers and set up a simple RAG pipeline:

```
chunks = [
    "OpenAI is one of the most recognized names in the large language model space, known for its GPT series of models. These models excel at generating human-like text and performing tasks like creative writing, answering questions, and summarizing content.

]
```

### Ingesting data in Vector Store

```
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")
```

```
from griptape.drivers.embedding.openai import OpenAiEmbeddingDriver
from griptape.drivers.vector.local import LocalVectorStoreDriver

# Set up a simple vector store with our data
vector_store = LocalVectorStoreDriver(embedding_driver=OpenAiEmbeddingDriver())
vector_store.upsert_collection({"major_llm_providers": chunks})
```

### Setting up the RAG Engine

```
from griptape.engines.rag import RagContext, RagEngine
from griptape.engines.rag.modules import (
    PromptResponseRagModule,
    VectorStoreRetrievalRagModule,
)
from griptape.engines.rag.stages import (
    ResponseRagStage,
    RetrievalRagStage,
)

# Create a basic RAG pipeline
rag_engine = RagEngine(
    # Stage for retrieving relevant chunks
    retrieval_stage=RetrievalRagStage(
        retrieval_modules=[
            VectorStoreRetrievalRagModule(
                name="VectorStore_Retriever",
                vector_store_driver=vector_store,
                query_params={"namespace": "major_llm_providers"},
            ),
        ],
    ),
    # Stage for generating a response
    response_stage=ResponseRagStage(
        response_modules=[
            PromptResponseRagModule(),
        ]
    ),
)
```

### Testing Our RAG Pipeline

Let's make sure our RAG pipeline works by testing it with a sample query:

```
rag_context = RagContext(query="What makes Meta AI’s LLaMA models stand out?")
rag_context = rag_engine.process(rag_context)
rag_context.outputs[0].to_text()
```

Output:

```
"Meta AI's LLaMA models stand out for their open-source nature, which makes them accessible to researchers and developers. This accessibility supports innovation and experimentation, allowing for collaboration across industries. By making high-quality models available for free, Meta AI aims to democratize AI development, which has been a game-changer for researchers without access to expensive resources."
```

## Ragas Evaluation

### Creating a Ragas Evaluation Dataset

```
questions = [
    "Who are the major players in the large language model space?",
    "What is Microsoft’s Azure AI platform known for?",
    "What kind of models does Cohere provide?",
]

references = [
    "The major players include OpenAI (GPT Series), Anthropic (Claude Series), Google DeepMind (Gemini Models), Meta AI (LLaMA Series), Microsoft Azure AI (integrating GPT Models), Amazon AWS (Bedrock with Claude and Jurassic), Cohere (business-focused models), and AI21 Labs (Jurassic Series).",
    "Microsoft’s Azure AI platform is known for integrating OpenAI’s GPT models, enabling businesses to use these models in a scalable and secure cloud environment.",
    "Cohere provides language models tailored for business use, excelling in tasks like search, summarization, and customer support.",
]

griptape_rag_contexts = []

for que in questions:
    rag_context = RagContext(query=que)
    griptape_rag_contexts.append(rag_engine.process(rag_context))
```

```
from ragas.integrations.griptape import transform_to_ragas_dataset

ragas_eval_dataset = transform_to_ragas_dataset(
    grip_tape_rag_contexts=griptape_rag_contexts, references=references
)
```

```
ragas_eval_dataset.to_pandas()
```

### Running the Ragas Evaluation

Now, let's evaluate our RAG system using Ragas metrics:

#### Evaluating Retrieval

To evaluate our retrieval performance, we can utilize Ragas built-in metrics or create custom metrics tailored to our specific needs. For a comprehensive list of all available metrics and customization options, please visit the documentation.

We will use `ContextPrecision`, `ContextRecall` and `ContextRelevance` to measure the retrieval performance:

* [ContextPrecision](../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/context_precision/): Measures how well a RAG system's retriever ranks relevant chunks at the top of the retrieved context for a given query, calculated as the mean precision@k across all chunks.
* [ContextRecall](../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/context_recall/): Measures the proportion of relevant information successfully retrieved from a knowledge base.
* [ContextRelevance](../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/nvidia_metrics/#context-relevance): Measures how well the retrieved contexts address the user’s query by evaluating their pertinence through dual LLM judgments.

```
from ragas.metrics import ContextPrecision, ContextRecall, ContextRelevance
from ragas import evaluate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from ragas.llms import LangchainLLMWrapper

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
evaluator_llm = LangchainLLMWrapper(llm)

ragas_metrics = [
    ContextPrecision(llm=evaluator_llm),
    ContextRecall(llm=evaluator_llm),
    ContextRelevance(llm=evaluator_llm),
]

retrieval_results = evaluate(dataset=ragas_eval_dataset, metrics=ragas_metrics)
retrieval_results.to_pandas()
```

```
Evaluating: 100%|██████████| 9/9 [00:15<00:00,  1.77s/it]
```

|  | user\_input | retrieved\_contexts | response | reference | context\_precision | context\_recall | nv\_context\_relevance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Who are the major players in the large languag... | [In the rapidly advancing field of artificial ... | The major players in the large language model ... | The major players include OpenAI (GPT Series),... | 1.000000 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| 1 | What is Microsoft’s Azure AI platform known for? | [Microsoft’s Azure AI platform is famous for i... | Microsoft’s Azure AI platform is known for int... | Microsoft’s Azure AI platform is known for int... | 1.000000 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| 2 | What kind of models does Cohere provide? | [Cohere is well-known for its language models ... | Cohere provides language models tailored for b... | Cohere provides language models tailored for b... | 0.833333 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

#### Evaluating Generation

To measure the generation performance we will use `FactualCorrectness`, `Faithfulness` and `ContextRelevance`:

* [FactualCorrectness](../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/factual_correctness/): Checks if all statements in a response are supported by the reference answer.
* [Faithfulness](../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/faithfulness/): Measures how factually consistent a response is with the retrieved context.
* [ResponseGroundedness](../../../concepts/metrics/available_metrics/nvidia_metrics/#response-groundedness): Measures whether the response is grounded in the provided context, helping to identify hallucinations or made-up information.

```
from ragas.metrics import FactualCorrectness, Faithfulness, ResponseGroundedness

ragas_metrics = [
    FactualCorrectness(llm=evaluator_llm),
    Faithfulness(llm=evaluator_llm),
    ResponseGroundedness(llm=evaluator_llm),
]

genration_results = evaluate(dataset=ragas_eval_dataset, metrics=ragas_metrics)
genration_results.to_pandas()
```

```
Evaluating: 100%|██████████| 9/9 [00:17<00:00,  1.90s/it]
```

|  | user\_input | retrieved\_contexts | response | reference | factual\_correctness(mode=f1) | faithfulness | nv\_response\_groundedness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Who are the major players in the large languag... | [In the rapidly advancing field of artificial ... | The major players in the large language model ... | The major players include OpenAI (GPT Series),... | 1.00 | 1.000000 | 1.0 |
| 1 | What is Microsoft’s Azure AI platform known for? | [Microsoft’s Azure AI platform is famous for i... | Microsoft’s Azure AI platform is known for int... | Microsoft’s Azure AI platform is known for int... | 0.57 | 0.833333 | 1.0 |
| 2 | What kind of models does Cohere provide? | [Cohere is well-known for its language models ... | Cohere provides language models tailored for b... | Cohere provides language models tailored for b... | 0.57 | 1.000000 | 1.0 |

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Ragas evaluation pipeline for your Griptape RAG system. This evaluation provides valuable insights into how well your system retrieves relevant information and generates accurate responses.

Remember that RAG evaluation is an iterative process. Use these metrics to identify weaknesses in your system, make improvements, and re-evaluate until you achieve the performance level you need.

Happy RAGging! 😄
