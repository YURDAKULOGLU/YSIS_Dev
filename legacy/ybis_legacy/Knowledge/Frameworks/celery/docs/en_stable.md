# Celery - Distributed Task Queue[¶](#celery-distributed-task-queue "Link to this heading")

Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to
process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with
the tools required to maintain such a system.

It’s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also
supporting task scheduling.
