## [​](#overview) Overview

Testing is a crucial part of the development process, and it is essential to ensure that your crew is performing as expected. With crewAI, you can easily test your crew and evaluate its performance using the built-in testing capabilities.

### [​](#using-the-testing-feature) Using the Testing Feature

We added the CLI command `crewai test` to make it easy to test your crew. This command will run your crew for a specified number of iterations and provide detailed performance metrics. The parameters are `n_iterations` and `model`, which are optional and default to 2 and `gpt-4o-mini` respectively. For now, the only provider available is OpenAI.

Copy

Ask AI

```
crewai test
```

If you want to run more iterations or use a different model, you can specify the parameters like this:

Copy

Ask AI

```
crewai test --n_iterations 5 --model gpt-4o
```

or using the short forms:

Copy

Ask AI

```
crewai test -n 5 -m gpt-4o
```

When you run the `crewai test` command, the crew will be executed for the specified number of iterations, and the performance metrics will be displayed at the end of the run.
A table of scores at the end will show the performance of the crew in terms of the following metrics:


| Tasks/Crew/Agents | Run 1 | Run 2 | Avg. Total | Agents | Additional Info |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 | 9.0 | 9.5 | **9.2** | Professional Insights |  |
|  |  |  |  | Researcher |  |
| Task 2 | 9.0 | 10.0 | **9.5** | Company Profile Investigator |  |
| Task 3 | 9.0 | 9.0 | **9.0** | Automation Insights |  |
|  |  |  |  | Specialist |  |
| Task 4 | 9.0 | 9.0 | **9.0** | Final Report Compiler | Automation Insights Specialist |
| Crew | 9.00 | 9.38 | **9.2** |  |  |
| Execution Time (s) | 126 | 145 | **135** |  |  |

The example above shows the test results for two runs of the crew with two tasks, with the average total score for each task and the crew as a whole.
