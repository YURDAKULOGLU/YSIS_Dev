## [​](#human-input-in-agent-execution) Human input in agent execution

Human input is critical in several agent execution scenarios, allowing agents to request additional information or clarification when necessary.
This feature is especially useful in complex decision-making processes or when agents require more details to complete a task effectively.

## [​](#using-human-input-with-crewai) Using human input with CrewAI

To integrate human input into agent execution, set the `human_input` flag in the task definition. When enabled, the agent prompts the user for input before delivering its final answer.
This input can provide extra context, clarify ambiguities, or validate the agent’s output.
