# Build applications with Neo4j and Python

The Neo4j Python driver is the official library to interact with a Neo4j instance through a Python application.

At the hearth of Neo4j lies [Cypher](#Cypher), the query language to interact with a Neo4j database.
Although this guide does not *require* you to be a seasoned Cypher querier, it’s easier to focus on the Python-specific bits if you know some Cypher already.
You will also get a *gentle* introduction to Cypher in these pages, but check out [Getting started → Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/cypher/) for a more detailed walkthrough of graph databases modelling and querying if this is your first approach.

## Install

Install the Neo4j Python driver with `pip`:

```
pip install neo4j
```

[More info on installing the driver](https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/install/)

## Connect to the database

Connect to a database by creating a `Driver` object and providing a URL and an authentication token.
Once you have a `Driver` instance, use the `.verify_connectivity()` method to ensure that a working connection can be established.

```
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# URI examples: "neo4j://localhost", "neo4j+s://xxx.databases.neo4j.io"
URI = "<database-uri>"
AUTH = ("<username>", "<password>")

with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
    driver.verify_connectivity()
```

[More info on connecting to a database](https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/connect/)

## Create an example graph

Run a Cypher query with the method `Driver.execute_query()`.
Do not hardcode or concatenate parameters: use placeholders and specify the parameters as keyword arguments.

Create two `Person` nodes and a `KNOWS` relationship between them

```
summary = driver.execute_query("""
    CREATE (a:Person {name: $name})
    CREATE (b:Person {name: $friendName})
    CREATE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)
    """,
    name="Alice", friendName="David",
    database_="<database-name>",
).summary
print("Created {nodes_created} nodes in {time} ms.".format(
    nodes_created=summary.counters.nodes_created,
    time=summary.result_available_after
))
```

## Query a graph

To retrieve information from the database, use the Cypher clause `MATCH`:

Retrieve all `Person` nodes who know other persons

```
records, summary, keys = driver.execute_query("""
    MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(:Person)
    RETURN p.name AS name
    """,
    database_="<database-name>",
)

# Loop through results and do something with them
for record in records:
    print(record.data())  # obtain record as dict

# Summary information
print("The query `{query}` returned {records_count} records in {time} ms.".format(
    query=summary.query, records_count=len(records),
    time=summary.result_available_after
))
```

## Close connections and sessions

Unless you created them using the `with` statement, call the `.close()` method on all `Driver` and `Session` instances to release any resources still held by them.

```
from neo4j import GraphDatabase


driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH)
session = driver.session(database="<database-name>")

# session/driver usage

session.close()
driver.close()
```

## Glossary

LTS
:   A *Long Term Support* release is one guaranteed to be supported for a number of years.
    Neo4j 4.4 and 5.26 are LTS versions.

Aura
:   [Aura](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/) is Neo4j’s fully managed cloud service.
    It comes with both free and paid plans.

Cypher
:   [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/cypher-overview/) is Neo4j’s graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the database.
    It is like SQL, but for graphs.

APOC
:   [Awesome Procedures On Cypher (APOC)](/docs/apoc/current/) is a library of (many) functions that can not be easily expressed in Cypher itself.

Bolt
:   [Bolt](/docs/bolt/current/) is the protocol used for interaction between Neo4j instances and drivers.
    It listens on port 7687 by default.

ACID
:   Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) are properties guaranteeing that database transactions are processed reliably.
    An ACID-compliant DBMS ensures that the data in the database remains accurate and consistent despite failures.

eventual consistency
:   A database is eventually consistent if it provides the guarantee that all cluster members will, *at some point in time*, store the latest version of the data.

causal consistency
:   A database is causally consistent if read and write queries are seen by every member of the cluster in the same order.
    This is stronger than *eventual consistency*.

NULL
:   The null marker is not a type but a placeholder for absence of value.
    For more information, see [Cypher → Working with `null`](/docs/cypher-manual/current/values-and-types/working-with-null/).

transaction
:   A transaction is a unit of work that is either *committed* in its entirety or *rolled back* on failure.
    An example is a bank transfer: it involves multiple steps, but they must *all* succeed or be reverted, to avoid money being subtracted from one account but not added to the other.

backpressure
:   Backpressure is a force opposing the flow of data. It ensures that the client is not being overwhelmed by data faster than it can handle.

bookmark
:   A *bookmark* is a token representing some state of the database. By passing one or multiple bookmarks along with a query, the server will make sure that the query does not get executed before the represented state(s) have been established.

transaction function
:   A transaction function is a callback executed by an `execute_read` or `execute_write` call. The driver automatically re-executes the callback in case of server failure.

Driver
:   A [`Driver`](/docs/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.Driver) object holds the details required to establish connections with a Neo4j database.
