* [Define an upstream and downstream deployment](#define-an-upstream-and-downstream-deployment)
* [Test it out](#test-it-out)

This example shows how to use a trigger to schedule a run of downstream deployment when a run of an upstream deployment completes.

## [​](#define-an-upstream-and-downstream-deployment) Define an upstream and downstream deployment

event\_driven\_deployments.py

Copy

```
from prefect import flow, serve
from prefect.events import DeploymentEventTrigger


@flow(log_prints=True)
def upstream_flow():
    print("upstream flow")


@flow(log_prints=True)
def downstream_flow():
    print("downstream flow")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    upstream_deployment = upstream_flow.to_deployment(name="upstream_deployment")
    downstream_deployment = downstream_flow.to_deployment(
        name="downstream_deployment",
        triggers=[
            DeploymentEventTrigger(
                expect={"prefect.flow-run.Completed"},
                match_related={"prefect.resource.name": "upstream_deployment"},
            )
        ],
    )

    serve(upstream_deployment, downstream_deployment)
```

## [​](#test-it-out) Test it out

First, start the `serve` process to listen for scheduled deployments runs:

Copy

```
python event_driven_deployments.py
```

Now, run the upstream deployment and see the downstream deployment kick off after it completes:

Copy

```
prefect deployment run upstream-flow/upstream_deployment
```

**Check the event feed**You can inspect raw events in the event feed in the UI to see what related resources are available to match against.For example, the following `prefect.flow-run.Completed` event’s related resources include:

Copy

```
{
   "related": [
    {
      "prefect.resource.id": "prefect.flow.10e099ec-8358-4146-b188-be68027ee58f",
      "prefect.resource.role": "flow",
      "prefect.resource.name": "upstream-flow"
    },
    {
      "prefect.resource.id": "prefect.deployment.be777bbd-4b15-49f3-bc1f-4d109374cee2",
      "prefect.resource.role": "deployment",
      "prefect.resource.name": "upstream_deployment"
    },
    {
      "prefect.resource.id": "prefect-cloud.user.80546602-9f31-4396-ab4b-e873a5377feb",
      "prefect.resource.role": "creator",
      "prefect.resource.name": "stoat"
    }
  ]
}
```
