### [​](#customize-a-workflow’s-name) Customize a workflow’s name

Give your workflow a name with the `name` parameter:

Copy

```
from prefect import flow


@flow(name="My Flow")
def my_workflow() -> str:
    return "Hello, world!"
```

If you don’t provide a name, Prefect uses the flow function name.

### [​](#customize-a-workflow’s-description) Customize a workflow’s description

Give your workflow a description with the `description` parameter:

Copy

```
from prefect import flow


@flow(name="My Flow", description="My flow with a name and description")
def my_workflow() -> str:
    return "Hello, world!"
```

If no description is provided, a flow function’s docstring is used as the description.

### [​](#customize-run-names) Customize run names

Give a custom name to each flow run for a flow with the `flow_run_name` parameter:

Copy

```
import datetime
from prefect import flow


@flow(flow_run_name="hello-{name}-on-{date:%A}")
def my_workflow(name: str, date: datetime.datetime):
    return f"I said hello to {name} on {date:%A}!"
```

Inputs to the flow function are available as variables in the `flow_run_name` template string.
You can also provide a `flow_run_name` as a function that returns a string:

Copy

```
import datetime
from prefect import flow


def generate_flow_run_name():
    date = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
    return f"{date:%A}-is-a-nice-day"


@flow(flow_run_name=generate_flow_run_name)
def my_workflow(name: str):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**Custom flow run names are applied at runtime**When a flow run is created via a schedule or the API, the `flow_run_name` defined on the flow is not immediately applied. The name is updated when the flow begins running.
