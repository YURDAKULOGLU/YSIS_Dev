# Fine-tune `vicuna-13b` with Lightning and DeepSpeed[#](#fine-tune-vicuna-13b-with-lightning-and-deepspeed "Link to this heading")

[![try-anyscale-quickstart](../../../_static/img/run-on-anyscale.svg)](https://console.anyscale.com/register/ha?render_flow=ray&utm_source=ray_docs&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=vicuna_13b_lightning_deepspeed_finetune)
  

In this example, we will demonstrate how to perform full fine-tuning for a [`vicuna-13b-v1.3`](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.3) model using Ray Train PyTorch Lightning integrations with the DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 strategy.

* [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) is an open-source deep learning optimization library for PyTorch. It’s designed to reduce computing power and memory usage, and to train large distributed models by leveraging state-of-the-art innovations like ZeRO, 3D-Parallelism, DeepSpeed-MoE, and ZeRO-Infinity.
* PyTorch Lightning offers a [DeepSpeed integration](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/pytorch_lightning.strategies.DeepSpeedStrategy.html), which provides a simple interface to configure the knobs for DeepSpeed and automatically trigger your training process with the DeepSpeed Engine.
* [`Ray TorchTrainer`](../../api/doc/ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer.html#ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer "ray.train.torch.TorchTrainer") allows you to easily scale your PyTorch Lightning job across multiple nodes in a Ray cluster, without worrying about the underlying cluster management, autoscaling, and distributed process group settings.

Our demo aims to illustrate how these three tools can be combined effectively to finetune the Vicuna-13B model, leveraging the strengths of each to create an efficient and high-performance deep learning solution.

Note

This is an advanced example of Large Language Model fine-tuning with Ray Train. If you’re a beginner or new to the concepts of Ray Train and our Lightning integrations, it would be beneficial to first explore the introductory documentation below to build a foundational understanding.

## Cluster Setting[#](#cluster-setting "Link to this heading")

### Compute instances[#](#compute-instances "Link to this heading")

In this example, we set up a Ray cluster on AWS with the following settings:

|  | num | instance type | GPU per node | GPU Memory | CPU Memory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Head node | 1 | g5.16xlarge | 1 x A10G | 24 GB | 256 GB |
| Worker node | 15 | g5.4xlarge | 1 x A10G | 24 GB | 64 GB |

Note

In this example, we used 16 A10G GPUs for model training and tuned the DeepSpeed configurations for this setup. If you have a different cluster setup or GPUs with lower memory capacities, you may need to modify the DeepSpeed configurations and batch size to fit the model into the GPUs.

Tip

We selected a GPU instance with additional CPU memory for the head node to demonstrate single-node offline inference. If you are training only, you can still opt for the g5.4xlarge instance for the head node.

### Cloud Storage[#](#cloud-storage "Link to this heading")

Additionally, since the checkpoint size for this 13B parameter model can be large (~140GB), we choose to store the checkpoints in AWS S3. Thanks to the newly introduced distributed checkpointing feature in Ray 2.5, each worker can upload its own shards individually to the S3 bucket, greatly reducing the latency and network traffic of checkpoint syncing.

### Local Storage[#](#local-storage "Link to this heading")

To demonstrate offline inference, we need to download and consolidate the model checkpoint onto the head node. This action requires around 200GB disk storage. Therefore, we mounted the NVMe SSD provided by g5 instances at `/dev/nvme1n1` to `/mnt/local_storage`, and we will save the checkpoints in this folder.

For more details, see [Amazon EBS and NVMe on Linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/nvme-ebs-volumes.html).

## Setup Ray Environment[#](#setup-ray-environment "Link to this heading")

We define a runtime environment to ensure that the Ray workers have access to all necessary packages. If you have already included these dependencies in your Docker image or installed them on each node, you can ignore the `runtime_env` argument.

Note

Note that the codebases of `transformers`, `accelerate`, and `deepspeed` are all rapidly changing, so we have pinned the package versions here to ensure testing stability. You can try other version combinations and feel free to report any issues you encounter.

```
import os
os.environ["RAY_TRAIN_V2_ENABLED"] = "1"
```

```
import ray

NUM_WORKERS = 16
BATCH_SIZE_PER_WORKER = 8
MODEL_NAME = "lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.3"

ray.init(
    runtime_env={
        "pip": [
            "datasets",
            "torch>=1.13.0",
            "deepspeed==0.12.3",
            "accelerate==0.20.3",
            "transformers==4.30.2",
            "lightning==2.0.3",
        ],
    }
)
```

## Load and preprocess datasets[#](#load-and-preprocess-datasets "Link to this heading")

We were impressed by LLM’s ability of zero-shot text-generation, while some LLMs may not perform well in code generation due to the lack of code in the training corpus. The CMU [CoNaLa](https://conala-corpus.github.io/)(The Code/Natural Language Challenge) was designed to test systems for generating program snippets from natural language. Each data record contains an intent sentence and a one-line code snippet. The goal is to fine-tune the Vicuna model on this dataset, enabling the model to generate correct and runnable code snippets, thereby achieving natural language intent. Here are some examples:

| intent | code snippet |
| --- | --- |
| “convert a list of integers into a single integer” | `r = int(''.join(map(str, x)))` |
| “normalize a pandas dataframe `df` by row” | `df.div(df.sum(axis=1), axis=0)` |
| “Convert string ‘03:55’ into datetime.time object” | `datetime.datetime.strptime('03:55', '%H:%M').time()` |

The CoNaLa team has released a dataset crawled from Stack Overflow, automatically filtered, then curated by annotators, split into 2379 training and 500 test examples. In addition, they also included an automatically-mined dataset with 600k examples. In this demo, we take all the curated data and the top 5000 mined data for fine-tuning.

Here we preprocess the CoNaLa dataset with Ray Data. You can also use HuggingFace Datasets and pass it directly to `LightningConfigBuilder.fit_params()`.

```
import re
import ray
import json
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from huggingface_hub import HfFileSystem
fs = HfFileSystem()

path = "hf://datasets/neulab/conala/data"
mined_path = path + "/conala-mined.json"
curated_path = path + "/conala-paired-train.json"

curated = ray.data.read_json(curated_path, filesystem=fs)
mined = ray.data.read_json(mined_path, filesystem=fs).limit(5000).materialize()

ray_ds = mined.union(curated)

# Build a prompt template for Vicuna-13b model
PROMPT_TEMPLATE = "Intent: {intent}\nOne-line code snippet: {snippet}"


def fill_prompt(batch):
    batch["input_sentence"] = batch.apply(
        lambda row: PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(
            intent=row["rewritten_intent"]
            if row["rewritten_intent"]
            else row["intent"],
            snippet=f"`{row['snippet']}`",
        )
        + "</s>",
        axis=1,
    )
    return batch[["input_sentence"]]


# Tokenize input sentences to tensors
def tokenize(batch):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
        MODEL_NAME, padding_side="left", use_fast=False
    )
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
    ret = tokenizer(
        list(batch["input_sentence"]),
        truncation=True,
        max_length=128,
        padding="max_length",
        return_tensors="np",
    )
    ret["labels"] = ret["input_ids"].copy()
    return dict(ret)

## Define a Lightning Module[#](#define-a-lightning-module "Link to this heading")

Here we load the pre-trained model weights from HuggingFace Model Hub, and wrap them into `pl.LightningModule`. We adopted the efficient model initialization techniques introduced in [Lightning-transformers](https://github.com/Lightning-Universe/lightning-transformers) to avoid unnecessary full weights loading.

```
import torch
import transformers
import lightning.pytorch as pl
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from deepspeed.ops.adam import DeepSpeedCPUAdam


class ZeRO3Config:
    def __init__(self, pl_module):
        self.config = pl_module.trainer.strategy.config

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self

    def is_zero3(self) -> bool:
        return True


def enable_transformers_pretrained_deepspeed_sharding(
    pl_module: "pl.LightningModule",
) -> None:
    transformers.deepspeed._hf_deepspeed_config_weak_ref = ZeRO3Config(pl_module)


class Vicuna13BModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Enable tf32 for better performance
        torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True

    def setup(self, stage) -> None:
        # Defer model initialization to inject deepspeed configs to HF.
        # During initialization, HF transformers can immediately partition 
        # the model across all gpus avoid the overhead in time and memory 
        # copying it on CPU or each GPU first.
        enable_transformers_pretrained_deepspeed_sharding(self)
        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
        if self.global_rank == 0:
            print("DeepSpeed Configs: ", self.trainer.strategy.config)
            print("Model Archetecture: ", self.model)

    def forward(self, batch):
        outputs = self.model(
            batch["input_ids"],
            labels=batch["labels"],
            attention_mask=batch["attention_mask"],
        )
        return outputs.loss

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        loss = self.forward(batch)
        self.log("train_loss", loss, prog_bar=True, on_step=True, sync_dist=True)
        return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
        return DeepSpeedCPUAdam(self.parameters(), lr=2e-5, weight_decay=0.01)
```

## DeepSpeed Configurations[#](#deepspeed-configurations "Link to this heading")

Before training, let’s calculate the memory usage of finetuning a `vicuna-13b` model. Assume we are using FP16 mixed-precision training, and the optimizer is Adam with FP32 states.

* Model parameters: 13(billion parameters) \* 2(FP16) ≈ 26GB
* Optimizer states: 13(billion parameters) \* 2(momentums per param) \* 4 (FP32) ≈ 52GB

As we can see, the model parameters themselves require 26GB, which cannot fit in a single A10G GPU, let alone the activations and optimizers states. Here, we use ZeRO stage-3 to partition the model, gradients, and optimizer states across 16 nodes. Additionally, we employ optimizer CPU offloading to reduce GRAM usage and increase throughput with larger batch sizes. We also disabled parameter offloading and activation checkpointing to improve the training speed.

Regarding other knobs such as `reduce_bucket_size`, `stage3_prefetch_bucket_size` and `stage3_param_persistence_threshold`, we kept them as the [default values in HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/deepspeed#zero3-config). Feel free to further adjust them to speed up the training process.

```
from transformers import AutoConfig

config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
HIDDEN_SIZE = config.hidden_size

deepspeed_configs = {
    "zero_allow_untested_optimizer": True,
    "bf16": {"enabled": True},
    "zero_optimization": {
        "stage": 3,
        "offload_optimizer": {"device": "cpu", "pin_memory": True},
        "overlap_comm": True,
        "contiguous_gradients": True,
        "reduce_bucket_size": HIDDEN_SIZE * HIDDEN_SIZE,
        "stage3_prefetch_bucket_size": 0.9 * HIDDEN_SIZE * HIDDEN_SIZE,
        "stage3_param_persistence_threshold": 10 * HIDDEN_SIZE,
    },
}
```

## Define your training function[#](#define-your-training-function "Link to this heading")

Finally, define the training function that will be launched on multiple workers. The training function is generally the same as the pure pytorch Lightning training code, with additional Ray Train utilities:

* [`RayDeepSpeedStrategy`](../../api/doc/ray.train.lightning.RayDeepSpeedStrategy.html#ray.train.lightning.RayDeepSpeedStrategy "ray.train.lightning.RayDeepSpeedStrategy"): Same argument list as Lightning DeepSpeedStrategy but integrated with Ray Train.
* [`RayLightningEnvironment`](../../api/doc/ray.train.lightning.RayLightningEnvironment.html#ray.train.lightning.RayLightningEnvironment "ray.train.lightning.RayLightningEnvironment"): Lightning environments for Ray cluster.
* [`RayTrainReportCallback`](../../api/doc/ray.train.lightning.RayTrainReportCallback.html#ray.train.lightning.RayTrainReportCallback "ray.train.lightning.RayTrainReportCallback"): On each epoch end, it reports the checkpoint from each worker to the ray train (distributed checkpointing).
* [`prepare_trainer()`](../../api/doc/ray.train.lightning.prepare_trainer.html#ray.train.lightning.prepare_trainer "ray.train.lightning.prepare_trainer"): Validate your lightning Trainer configurations.

For Ray Data ingestion, we fetched the preprocessed and sharded dataset with [`get_dataset_shard()`](../../api/doc/ray.train.get_dataset_shard.html#ray.train.get_dataset_shard "ray.train.get_dataset_shard"), and created a dataloader with [`iter_torch_batches()`](../../../data/api/doc/ray.data.Dataset.iter_torch_batches.html#ray.data.Dataset.iter_torch_batches "ray.data.Dataset.iter_torch_batches"). It returns a custom iterator that replaces the Torch DataLoader.

## Model Fine-tuning[#](#model-fine-tuning "Link to this heading")

Once everything is configured in TorchTrainer, training becomes easy. Simply call `trainer.fit()`, and your workload will be scaled to the Ray cluster, initiating ZeRO-3 parallel training.

Now, it’s time to play with our fine-tuned Vicuna code generator!

The deepspeed ZeRO-3 checkpoint is a directory containing of k shards (k=16 in our case).

* `zero_pp_rank_k_mp_rank_00_model_states.pt`: contains the model parameter skeleton of shard k.
* `bf16_zero_pp_rank_k_mp_rank_00_optim_states.pt`: contains the actual flattened model parameters and optimizer states of shard k.

Next, we removed the optimizer states and consolidate the checkpoint into a single binary file using DeepSpeed utilities. Also, since we wrapped vicuna-13b within a `LightningModule`, we need to remove the prefix `_forward_module.model.model` so that we can directly load the checkpoint into a HF vicuna model.

```
import os
import torch
from deepspeed.utils.zero_to_fp32 import get_fp32_state_dict_from_zero_checkpoint

def extract_fp32_ckpt_from_zero(zero_ckpt_dir):
    state_dict = get_fp32_state_dict_from_zero_checkpoint(zero_ckpt_dir)
    vicuna_state_dict = {
        k.replace("_forward_module.model.", ""): v for k, v in state_dict.items()
    }
    torch.save(vicuna_state_dict, os.path.join(zero_ckpt_dir, "full_model.pt"))
```

```
Processing zero checkpoint '/mnt/cluster_storage/vicuna-13b-finetune/checkpoint_2025-10-15_16-04-29.037536/checkpoint.ckpt/checkpoint'

```

### Initialize Generation Pipeline[#](#initialize-generation-pipeline "Link to this heading")

Here, we leverage the Accelerate library to efficiently load the model onto a suitable device(GPU and CPU) and generate a HF text generation pipeline.

* Initialize an empty model on metadevice
* Create valid device mappings for the vicuna-13b model
* Load and distribute model weights to target devices

This ensures that only 1x model size of RAM is used for model initialization.

```
import shutil
import torch
import ray
import lightning.pytorch as pl
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline
from accelerate import (
    init_empty_weights,
    infer_auto_device_map,
    load_checkpoint_and_dispatch,
)


def generate_sample_outputs(model_checkpoint_path, prompts):
    # Initialize a model on meta device
    with init_empty_weights():
        config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
        meta_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(config)
    meta_model.tie_weights()

    # Define the device mapping
    device_map = infer_auto_device_map(
        meta_model,
        max_memory={0: "15GB", "cpu": "60GB"},
        no_split_module_classes=["LlamaDecoderLayer"],
    )

    local_checkpoint_path = "/mnt/local_storage/vicuna_ckpt"
    shutil.copytree(model_checkpoint_path, local_checkpoint_path)

    extract_fp32_ckpt_from_zero(local_checkpoint_path)

    full_model_ckpt_path = os.path.join(local_checkpoint_path, "full_model.pt")

    # Load the model parameters
    model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(
        meta_model,
        checkpoint=full_model_ckpt_path,
        device_map=device_map,
    )

    generator = pipeline(
        "text-generation",
        model=model,
        device_map=device_map,
        tokenizer=AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
            MODEL_NAME, padding_side="left", use_fast=False
        ),
    )

    for sample_prompt in prompts:
        prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(intent=sample_prompt["intent"], snippet="")
        output = generator(prompt, max_new_tokens=30, do_sample=True)
        print(output[0]["generated_text"])
```

### Case Study[#](#case-study "Link to this heading")

We took 3 examples from the CoNaLa’s test split for demo:

```
testcases = [
    {
        "intent": "replace white spaces in colunm 'col' of dataframe `df` with '_'",
    },
    {
        "intent": "search for occurrences of regex pattern '>.*<' in xml string `line`",
    },
    {
        "intent": "send a signal `signal.SIGUSR1` to the current process",
    },
]
```

```
generate_sample_outputs(os.path.join(result.checkpoint.path, "checkpoint.ckpt"), testcases)
```

### Test the Generated Code Snippets[#](#test-the-generated-code-snippets "Link to this heading")

The generated code snippets look pretty reasonable. The results covered Pandas operations, regular expressions, and Linux commands. Let’s test them one by one.

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({"col": ["abc def ghi", " 12 3 456", "     "]})
print("Before\n", df)

df["col"] = df["col"].str.replace(" ", "_")
print("After\n", df)
```

```
import re

line = """
<bookstore>
  <book category="fiction">
    <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
    <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
    <year>1925</year>
  </book>
  <book category="non-fiction">
    <title>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</title>
    <author>Yuval Noah Harari</author>
    <year>2011</year>
  </book>
</bookstore>
"""
re.findall(">.*<", line)
```

Finally, let’s hand it over to LLM and let it wrap up the demo:

```
import os, signal

# Don't actually kill the process, it's just for demo :D
# os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGUSR1)  # Terminate the current process~
```
