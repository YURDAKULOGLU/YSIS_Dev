Community Updates — Requests 2.32.5 documentation

# Community Updates[¶](#community-updates "Link to this heading")

If you’d like to stay up to date on the community and development of Requests,
there are several options:

## GitHub[¶](#github "Link to this heading")

The best way to track the development of Requests is through
[the GitHub repo](https://github.com/psf/requests).

# Release History[¶](#release-history "Link to this heading")

## dev[¶](#dev "Link to this heading")

* [Short description of non-trivial change.]

## 2.32.5 (2025-08-18)[¶](#id1 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* The SSLContext caching feature originally introduced in 2.32.0 has created
  a new class of issues in Requests that have had negative impact across a number
  of use cases. The Requests team has decided to revert this feature as long term
  maintenance of it is proving to be unsustainable in its current iteration.

**Deprecations**
- Added support for Python 3.14.
- Dropped support for Python 3.8 following its end of support.

## 2.32.4 (2025-06-10)[¶](#id2 "Link to this heading")

**Security**
- CVE-2024-47081 Fixed an issue where a maliciously crafted URL and trusted

> environment will retrieve credentials for the wrong hostname/machine from a
> netrc file.

**Improvements**
- Numerous documentation improvements

**Deprecations**
- Added support for pypy 3.11 for Linux and macOS.
- Dropped support for pypy 3.9 following its end of support.

## 2.32.3 (2024-05-29)[¶](#id3 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed bug breaking the ability to specify custom SSLContexts in sub-classes of

> HTTPAdapter. (#6716)

* Fixed issue where Requests started failing to run on Python versions compiled
  without the ssl module. (#6724)

## 2.32.2 (2024-05-21)[¶](#id4 "Link to this heading")

**Deprecations**
- To provide a more stable migration for custom HTTPAdapters impacted

> by the CVE changes in 2.32.0, we’ve renamed \_get\_connection to
> a new public API, get\_connection\_with\_tls\_context. Existing custom
> HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API.
> get\_connection is considered deprecated in all versions of Requests>=2.32.0.
>
> A minimal (2-line) example has been provided in the linked PR to ease
> migration, but we strongly urge users to evaluate if their custom adapter
> is subject to the same issue described in CVE-2024-35195. (#6710)

## 2.32.1 (2024-05-20)[¶](#id5 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**
- Add missing test certs to the sdist distributed on PyPI.

## 2.32.0 (2024-05-20)[¶](#id6 "Link to this heading")

**Security**
- Fixed an issue where setting verify=False on the first request from a

> Session will cause subsequent requests to the \_same [origin\_](#id158) to also ignore
> cert verification, regardless of the value of verify.
> (<https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56>)

**Improvements**
- verify=True now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve

> request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should
> also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python
> version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)

* Requests now supports optional use of character detection
  (chardet or charset\_normalizer) when repackaged or vendored.
  This enables pip and other projects to minimize their vendoring
  surface area. The Response.text() and apparent\_encoding APIs
  will default to utf-8 if neither library is present. (#6702)

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly

> calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)

* Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)
* Fixed bug where an extra leading / (path separator) could lead
  urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)

**Deprecations**

* Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)
* Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)
* Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)
* Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)

**Documentation**
- Various typo fixes and doc improvements.

**Packaging**
- Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.

> The source files for the projects (formerly requests) is now located
> in src/requests in the Requests sdist. (#6506)

* Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system
  using hatchling. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old
  versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.

## 2.31.0 (2023-05-22)[¶](#id7 "Link to this heading")

**Security**
- Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential

> forwarding of Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when
> following HTTPS redirects.
>
> When proxies are defined with user info (https://user:pass@proxy:8080), Requests
> will construct a Proxy-Authorization header that is attached to the request to
> authenticate with the proxy.
>
> In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached
> the Proxy-Authorization header incorrectly, resulting in the value being
> sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on
> defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade
> to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy
> credentials once the change has been fully deployed.
>
> Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through
> the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this
> vulnerability.
>
> Full details can be read in our [Github Security Advisory](<https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q>)
> and [CVE-2023-32681](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681>).

## 2.30.0 (2023-05-03)[¶](#id8 "Link to this heading")

**Dependencies**
- ⚠️ Added support for urllib3 2.0. ⚠️

> This may contain minor breaking changes so we advise careful testing and
> reviewing <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html>
> prior to upgrading.
>
> Users who wish to stay on urllib3 1.x can pin to urllib3<2.

## 2.29.0 (2023-04-26)[¶](#id9 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Requests now defers chunked requests to the urllib3 implementation to improve
  standardization. (#6226)
* Requests relaxes header component requirements to support bytes/str subclasses. (#6356)

## 2.28.2 (2023-01-12)[¶](#id10 "Link to this heading")

**Dependencies**

* Requests now supports charset\_normalizer 3.x. (#6261)

**Bugfixes**

* Updated MissingSchema exception to suggest https scheme rather than http. (#6188)

## 2.28.1 (2022-06-29)[¶](#id11 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Speed optimization in iter\_content with transition to yield from. (#6170)

**Dependencies**

* Added support for chardet 5.0.0 (#6179)
* Added support for charset-normalizer 2.1.0 (#6169)

## 2.28.0 (2022-06-09)[¶](#id12 "Link to this heading")

**Deprecations**

* ⚠️ Requests has officially dropped support for Python 2.7. ⚠️ (#6091)
* Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.6 (including pypy3.6). (#6091)

**Improvements**

* Wrap JSON parsing issues in Request’s JSONDecodeError for payloads without
  an encoding to make json() API consistent. (#6097)
* Parse header components consistently, raising an InvalidHeader error in
  all invalid cases. (#6154)
* Added provisional 3.11 support with current beta build. (#6155)
* Requests got a makeover and we decided to paint it black. (#6095)

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed bug where setting CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE to an empty string would disable
  cert verification. All Requests 2.x versions before 2.28.0 are affected. (#6074)
* Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping urllib3.exceptions.SSLError with
  requests.exceptions.SSLError for content and iter\_content. (#6057)
* Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entries caused proxy resolution
  to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry. (#6149)
* Fixed issue where entire payload could be included in the error message for
  JSONDecodeError. (#6036)

## 2.27.1 (2022-01-05)[¶](#id13 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed parsing issue that resulted in the auth component being
  dropped from proxy URLs. (#6028)

## 2.27.0 (2022-01-03)[¶](#id14 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Officially added support for Python 3.10. (#5928)
* Added a requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError to unify JSON exceptions between
  Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the response.json() method, and is
  backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.
  Can be caught from requests.exceptions.RequestException as well. (#5856)
* Improved error text for misnamed InvalidSchema and MissingSchema
  exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed
  (Schema->Scheme). (#6017)
* Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address
  recent changes to urlparse in Python 3.9+. (#5917)

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed defect in extract\_zipped\_paths which could result in an infinite loop
  for some paths. (#5851)
* Fixed handling for AttributeError when calculating length of files obtained
  by Tarfile.extractfile(). (#5239)
* Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader with
  requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader. (#5914)
* Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (#5391)
* Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where Proxy-Authorization was
  incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with Session.send. (#5924)
* Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of
  proxies available in the environment. (#5924)
* Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping UnicodeError with
  requests.exceptions.InvalidURL for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the
  domain. (#5414)

**Deprecations**

* Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022. While we
  don’t have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be the last release
  series providing support.

## 2.26.0 (2021-07-13)[¶](#id15 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Requests now supports Brotli compression, if either the brotli or
  brotlicffi package is installed. (#5783)
* Session.send now correctly resolves proxy configurations from both
  the Session and Request. Behavior now matches Session.request. (#5681)

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed a race condition in zip extraction when using Requests in parallel
  from zip archive. (#5707)

**Dependencies**

* Instead of chardet, use the MIT-licensed charset\_normalizer for Python3
  to remove license ambiguity for projects bundling requests. If chardet
  is already installed on your machine it will be used instead of charset\_normalizer
  to keep backwards compatibility. (#5797)

  You can also install chardet while installing requests by
  specifying [use\_chardet\_on\_py3] extra as follows:

  > `` `shell
  > pip install "requests[use_chardet_on_py3]"
  > ` ``

  Python2 still depends upon the chardet module.
* Requests now supports idna 3.x on Python 3. idna 2.x will continue to
  be used on Python 2 installations. (#5711)

**Deprecations**

* The requests[security] extra has been converted to a no-op install.
  PyOpenSSL is no longer the recommended secure option for Requests. (#5867)
* Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.5. (#5867)

## 2.25.1 (2020-12-16)[¶](#id16 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Requests now treats application/json as utf8 by default. Resolving
  inconsistencies between r.text and r.json output. (#5673)

**Dependencies**

* Requests now supports chardet v4.x.

## 2.25.0 (2020-11-11)[¶](#id17 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Added support for NETRC environment variable. (#5643)

**Dependencies**

* Requests now supports urllib3 v1.26.

**Deprecations**

* Requests v2.25.x will be the last release series with support for Python 3.5.
* The requests[security] extra is officially deprecated and will be removed
  in Requests v2.26.0.

## 2.24.0 (2020-06-17)[¶](#id18 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* pyOpenSSL TLS implementation is now only used if Python
  either doesn’t have an ssl module or doesn’t support
  SNI. Previously pyOpenSSL was unconditionally used if available.
  This applies even if pyOpenSSL is installed via the
  requests[security] extra (#5443)
* Redirect resolution should now only occur when
  allow\_redirects is True. (#5492)
* No longer perform unnecessary Content-Length calculation for
  requests that won’t use it. (#5496)

## 2.23.0 (2020-02-19)[¶](#id19 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Remove defunct reference to prefetch in Session \_\_attrs\_\_ (#5110)

**Bugfixes**

* Requests no longer outputs password in basic auth usage warning. (#5099)

**Dependencies**

* Pinning for chardet and idna now uses major version instead of minor.
  This hopefully reduces the need for releases every time a dependency is updated.

## 2.22.0 (2019-05-15)[¶](#id20 "Link to this heading")

**Dependencies**

* Requests now supports urllib3 v1.25.2.
  (note: 1.25.0 and 1.25.1 are incompatible)

**Deprecations**

* Requests has officially stopped support for Python 3.4.

## 2.21.0 (2018-12-10)[¶](#id21 "Link to this heading")

**Dependencies**

* Requests now supports idna v2.8.

## 2.20.1 (2018-11-08)[¶](#id22 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed bug with unintended Authorization header stripping for
  redirects using default ports (http/80, https/443).

## 2.20.0 (2018-10-18)[¶](#id23 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Content-Type header parsing is now case-insensitive (e.g.
  charset=utf8 v Charset=utf8).
* Fixed exception leak where certain redirect urls would raise
  uncaught urllib3 exceptions.
* Requests removes Authorization header from requests redirected
  from https to http on the same hostname. (CVE-2018-18074)
* should\_bypass\_proxies now handles URIs without hostnames (e.g.
  files).

**Dependencies**

* Requests now supports urllib3 v1.24.

**Deprecations**

* Requests has officially stopped support for Python 2.6.

## 2.19.1 (2018-06-14)[¶](#id24 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed issue where status\_codes.py’s init function failed trying
  to append to a \_\_doc\_\_ value of None.

## 2.19.0 (2018-06-12)[¶](#id25 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Warn user about possible slowdown when using cryptography version
  &lt; 1.3.4
* Check for invalid host in proxy URL, before forwarding request to
  adapter.
* Fragments are now properly maintained across redirects. (RFC7231
  7.1.2)
* Removed use of cgi module to expedite library load time.
* Added support for SHA-256 and SHA-512 digest auth algorithms.
* Minor performance improvement to Request.content.
* Migrate to using collections.abc for 3.7 compatibility.

**Bugfixes**

* Parsing empty Link headers with parse\_header\_links() no longer
  return one bogus entry.
* Fixed issue where loading the default certificate bundle from a zip
  archive would raise an IOError.
* Fixed issue with unexpected ImportError on windows system which do
  not support winreg module.
* DNS resolution in proxy bypass no longer includes the username and
  password in the request. This also fixes the issue of DNS queries
  failing on macOS.
* Properly normalize adapter prefixes for url comparison.
* Passing None as a file pointer to the files param no longer
  raises an exception.
* Calling copy on a RequestsCookieJar will now preserve the cookie
  policy correctly.

**Dependencies**

* We now support idna v2.7.
* We now support urllib3 v1.23.

## 2.18.4 (2017-08-15)[¶](#id26 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for
  easier debugging

**Dependencies**

* We now support idna v2.6.

## 2.18.3 (2017-08-02)[¶](#id27 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Running $ python -m requests.help now includes the installed
  version of idna.

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed issue where Requests would raise ConnectionError instead of
  SSLError when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.

## 2.18.2 (2017-07-25)[¶](#id28 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* requests.help no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of
  ssl.OPENSSL\_VERSION\_NUMBER.

**Dependencies**

* We now support urllib3 v1.22.

## 2.18.1 (2017-06-14)[¶](#id29 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fix an error in the packaging whereby the \*.whl contained
  incorrect data that regressed the fix in v2.17.3.

## 2.18.0 (2017-06-14)[¶](#id30 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Response is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a
  with statement without first having to be wrapped by
  contextlib.closing().

**Bugfixes**

* Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available
* Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the
  number of CPU cores
* Resolve error swallowing in utils set\_environ generator

## 2.17.3 (2017-05-29)[¶](#id31 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Improved packages namespace identity support, for monkeypatching
  libraries.

## 2.17.2 (2017-05-29)[¶](#id32 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Improved packages namespace identity support, for monkeypatching
  libraries.

## 2.17.1 (2017-05-29)[¶](#id33 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Improved packages namespace identity support, for monkeypatching
  libraries.

## 2.17.0 (2017-05-29)[¶](#id34 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.

## 2.16.5 (2017-05-28)[¶](#id35 "Link to this heading")

* Improvements to $ python -m requests.help.

## 2.16.4 (2017-05-27)[¶](#id36 "Link to this heading")

* Introduction of the $ python -m requests.help command, for
  debugging with maintainers!

## 2.16.3 (2017-05-27)[¶](#id37 "Link to this heading")

* Further restored the requests.packages namespace for compatibility
  reasons.

## 2.16.2 (2017-05-27)[¶](#id38 "Link to this heading")

* Further restored the requests.packages namespace for compatibility
  reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be necessary any longer.

## 2.16.1 (2017-05-27)[¶](#id39 "Link to this heading")

* Restored the requests.packages namespace for compatibility
  reasons.
* Bugfix for urllib3 version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the
requests.packages namespace previously will have to import code that
rests at this module-level now.

For example:

> from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be:

> from requests.packages import urllib3
> urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better:

> from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

## 2.16.0 (2017-05-26)[¶](#id40 "Link to this heading")

* Unvendor ALL the things!

## 2.15.1 (2017-05-26)[¶](#id41 "Link to this heading")

* Everyone makes mistakes.

## 2.15.0 (2017-05-26)[¶](#id42 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Introduction of the Response.next property, for getting the next
  PreparedResponse from a redirect chain (when
  allow\_redirects=False).
* Internal refactoring of \_\_version\_\_ module.

**Bugfixes**

* Restored once-optional parameter for
  requests.utils.get\_environ\_proxies().

## 2.14.2 (2017-05-10)[¶](#id43 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency
  markers to widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.

## 2.14.1 (2017-05-09)[¶](#id44 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.

## 2.14.0 (2017-05-09)[¶](#id45 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* It is now possible to pass no\_proxy as a key to the proxies
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the NO\_PROXY environment
  variable.
* When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or
  directories Requests now raises IOError, rather than failing at
  the time of the HTTPS request with a fairly inscrutable certificate
  validation error.
* The behavior of SessionRedirectMixin was slightly altered.
  resolve\_redirects will now detect a redirect by calling
  get\_redirect\_target(response) instead of directly querying
  Response.is\_redirect and Response.headers[‘location’]. Advanced
  users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
* Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have
  higher resolution on Windows.
* Added win\_inet\_pton as conditional dependency for the [socks]
  extra on Windows with Python 2.7.
* Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn’t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
* URLs with schemes that begin with http but are not http or
  https no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

* Much improved handling of non-ASCII Location header values in
  redirects. Fewer UnicodeDecodeErrors are encountered on Python 2,
  and Python 3 now correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to
  be the correct encoding.
* If an attempt to seek file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length
  calculations.
* Restricted HTTPDigestAuth to only respond to auth challenges made
  on 4XX responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
* Fixed some code that was firing DeprecationWarning on Python 3.6.
* The dismayed person emoticon (/o\) no longer has a big head. I’m
  sure this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
* Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
* Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
* Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.

## 2.13.0 (2017-01-24)[¶](#id46 "Link to this heading")

**Features**

* Only load the idna library when we’ve determined we need it. This
  will save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
* Updated bundled idna to 2.2.

## 2.12.5 (2017-01-18)[¶](#id47 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.

## 2.12.4 (2016-12-14)[¶](#id48 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in
  the basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been
  re-added, the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the
  future.

## 2.12.3 (2016-12-01)[¶](#id49 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with
  “http”. These URLs have historically been processed as though they
  were HTTP-schemed URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was
  removed in v2.12.2 in an overzealous attempt to resolve problems
  with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This change was reverted: the other
  fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to be sufficient to return
  to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.

## 2.12.2 (2016-11-30)[¶](#id50 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically
  invalid but which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to
  IDNA-encode a URL if it can but, if it fails, and the host contains
  only ASCII characters, it will be passed through optimistically.
  This will allow users to opt-in to using IDNA2003 themselves if they
  want to, and will also allow technically invalid but still common
  hostnames.
* Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  InvalidSchema errors.
* Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes
  would still have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
* Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic
  auth.
* Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where
  constructing a Response object would cause Response.content to
  raise an AttributeError.

## 2.12.1 (2016-11-16)[¶](#id51 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Updated setuptools ‘security’ extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in
  urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.

## 2.12.0 (2016-11-15)[¶](#id52 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to
  IDNA2008. This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs
  and is mandatory for .de domains.
* Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will
  no longer read an entire StringIO into memory.
* Much improved logic for recalculating Content-Length headers for
  PreparedRequest objects.
* Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no tell method
  but do have a seek method.
* Anything that is a subclass of Mapping is now treated like a
  dictionary by the data= keyword argument.
* Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather
  than stripping the credentials.
* If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that
  request is redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will
  now attempt to rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

* When calling response.close, the call to close will be
  propagated through to non-urllib3 backends.
* Fixed issue where the ALL\_PROXY environment variable would be
  preferred over scheme-specific variables like HTTP\_PROXY.
* Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by
  falling back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
* Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set
  when using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the
  native string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
* Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.

## 2.11.1 (2016-08-17)[¶](#id53 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed a bug when using iter\_content with decode\_unicode=True for
  streamed bodies would raise AttributeError. This bug was
  introduced in 2.11.
* Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header
  block when following a redirect that transforms the verb from
  POST/PUT to GET.

## 2.11.0 (2016-08-08)[¶](#id54 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Added support for the ALL\_PROXY environment variable.
* Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline
  characters to reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed occasional TypeError when attempting to decode a JSON
  response that occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a
  ValueError.
* Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the
  NO\_PROXY environment variables: Requests now treats it as a
  specific IP.
* Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter
  obscure OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
* Added type checks to ensure that iter\_content only accepts
  integers and None for chunk sizes.
* Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed
  would have the underlying connection closed but not returned to the
  connection pool, which could cause Requests to hang in situations
  where the HTTPAdapter had been configured to use a blocking
  connection pool.

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.
* Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as
  acceptable header values. This release does not.

## 2.10.0 (2016-04-29)[¶](#id55 "Link to this heading")

**New Features**

* SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks;
  $ pip install requests[socks])

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.

## 2.9.2 (2016-04-29)[¶](#id56 "Link to this heading")

**Improvements**

* Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use
  OrderedDict as its underlying datastore.

**Bugfixes**

* Don’t use redirect\_cache if allow\_redirects=False
* When passed objects that throw exceptions from tell(), send them
  via chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.
* Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.

## 2.9.1 (2015-12-21)[¶](#id57 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to
  send binary strings as bodies in Python 3.
* Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain
  locales.

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.

## 2.9.0 (2015-12-15)[¶](#id58 "Link to this heading")

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)

* The verify keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a
  directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.
* Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.
* Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the
  status code registry.

**Bugfixes**

* For file-like objects that are not sought to the very beginning, we
  now send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually
  read, rather than the total size of the file, allowing partial file
  uploads.
* When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no
  obvious content length we set Transfer-Encoding: chunked rather
  than Content-Length: 0.
* We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading
  chunked bodies.
* We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python
  3, by decoding it as UTF-8.
* Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when
  using the functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the
  garbage collector to clean them up.
* Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed qop
  directive that contains no token, by treating it the same as if no
  qop directive was provided at all.
* Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by
  name.

**Miscellaneous**

* Updated urllib3 to 1.13.

## 2.8.1 (2015-10-13)[¶](#id59 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Update certificate bundle to match certifi 2015.9.6.2’s weak
  certificate bundle.
* Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ConnectTimeout
  instead of ConnectionError
* When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly
  respect the json parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.
* When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly
  handle a Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.

## 2.8.0 (2015-10-05)[¶](#id60 "Link to this heading")

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)

* Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the proxies
  dictionary to have entries of the form
  {‘<scheme>://<hostname>’: ‘<proxy>’}. Host-specific proxies will
  be used in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific
  ones, but the previous syntax will continue to work.
* Response.raise\_for\_status now prints the URL that failed as part
  of the exception message.
* requests.utils.get\_netrc\_auth now takes an raise\_errors kwarg,
  defaulting to False. When True, errors parsing .netrc files
  cause exceptions to be thrown.
* Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to
  unbundle requests downstream.
* Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on
  Linux: now contains only the requests version.

**Bugfixes**

* The json parameter to post() and friends will now only be used
  if neither data nor files are present, consistent with the
  documentation.
* We now ignore empty fields in the NO\_PROXY environment variable.
* Fixed problem where httplib.BadStatusLine would get raised if
  combining stream=True with contextlib.closing.
* Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection
  back to the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.
* Miscellaneous minor internal changes.
* Digest Auth support is now thread safe.

**Updates**

* Updated urllib3 to 1.12.

## 2.7.0 (2015-05-03)[¶](#id61 "Link to this heading")

This is the first release that follows our new release process. For
more, see [our
documentation](<https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/release-process/>).

**Bugfixes**

* Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked
  transfer encoding and response framing.

## 2.6.2 (2015-04-23)[¶](#id62 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

  was not properly decompressed. (#2561)

## 2.6.1 (2015-04-22)[¶](#id63 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.

  user to pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f.
  #2552)
* Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original
  arguments to the adapter. (#2503)
* Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL
  that cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)
* Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest
  Authentication. (#2426)
* Copy a PreparedRequest’s CookieJar more reliably when it is not an
  instance of RequestsCookieJar. (#2527)

## 2.6.0 (2015-03-14)[¶](#id64 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a
  cookie without a host value set would use the hostname for the
  redirected URL exposing requests users to session fixation attacks
  and potentially cookie stealing. This was disclosed privately by
  Matthew Daley of [BugFuzz](<https://bugfuzz.com>). This affects all
  versions of requests from v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).
* Fix error when requests is an install\_requires dependency and
  python setup.py test is run. (#2462)
* Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use
  the vendored import location.
* Include fixes to urllib3’s header handling.
* Requests’ handling of unvendored dependencies is now more
  restrictive.

**Features and Improvements**

* Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the files
  argument. (#2468)
* Avoid data duplication when creating a request with str, bytes,
  or bytearray input to the files argument.

## 2.5.3 (2015-02-24)[¶](#id65 "Link to this heading")

**Bugfixes**

* Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context

  ([shazow/urllib3#544](<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/544>))

**Bugfixes**

* Copy pip’s import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove
  requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let
  those same symbols work. Example usage in requests’ documentation
  and 3rd-party libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3
  will work without having to fallback to the system urllib3.
* Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then
  quoting fails. (#2356)
* Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (#2411)
* Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest
  authentication challenges provides both auth and auth-int
  qop-values. (#2408)
* Fix a socket leak.
  ([shazow/urllib3#549](<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/549>))

  or encoded ‘#’ character.
* Assorted urllib3 fixes.

## 2.2.0 (2014-01-09)[¶](#id75 "Link to this heading")

## 2.0.0 (2013-09-24)[¶](#id78 "Link to this heading")

**API Changes:**

* Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python
  versions, i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.

  PreparedRequest.copy().
* Added new method to Session objects: Session.update\_request().
  This method updates a Request object with the data (e.g. cookies)
  stored on the Session.
* Added new method to Session objects: Session.prepare\_request().
  This method updates and prepares a Request object, and returns the
  corresponding PreparedRequest object.
* Added new method to HTTPAdapter objects:
  HTTPAdapter.proxy\_headers(). This should not be called directly,
  but improves the subclass interface.
* httplib.IncompleteRead exceptions caused by incorrect chunked
  encoding will now raise a Requests ChunkedEncodingError instead.
* Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests InvalidURL
  exception to be raised.
* HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase “im\_used”. Correctly uses
  “already\_reported”.
* HTTP 226 reason added (“im\_used”).

  hooks can make a secondary request with the same parameters. This is
  especially necessary for authentication handler authors
* certifi support was removed
* Fixed bug where using OAuth 1 with body signature\_type sent no
  data
* Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy
  authentication from the proxy url
