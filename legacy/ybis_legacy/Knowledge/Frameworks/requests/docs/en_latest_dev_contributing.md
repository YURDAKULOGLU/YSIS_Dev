Contributor’s Guide — Requests 2.32.5 documentation

# Contributor’s Guide[¶](#contributor-s-guide "Link to this heading")

If you’re reading this, you’re probably interested in contributing to Requests.
Thank you very much! Open source projects live-and-die based on the support
they receive from others, and the fact that you’re even considering
contributing to the Requests project is *very* generous of you.

This document lays out guidelines and advice for contributing to this project.
If you’re thinking of contributing, please start by reading this document and
getting a feel for how contributing to this project works. If you have any
questions, feel free to reach out to either [Nate Prewitt](https://www.nateprewitt.com/), [Ian Cordasco](http://www.coglib.com/~icordasc/),
or [Seth Michael Larson](https://sethmlarson.dev/), the primary maintainers.

The guide is split into sections based on the type of contribution you’re
thinking of making, with a section that covers general guidelines for all
contributors.

## Code of Conduct[¶](#code-of-conduct "Link to this heading")

The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse
set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences
that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you’re
working with members of the community, follow the
[Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/) to help steer your interactions
and keep Python a positive, successful, and growing community.

## Get Early Feedback[¶](#get-early-feedback "Link to this heading")

If you are contributing, do not feel the need to sit on your contribution until
it is perfectly polished and complete. It helps everyone involved for you to
seek feedback as early as you possibly can. Submitting an early, unfinished
version of your contribution for feedback in no way prejudices your chances of
getting that contribution accepted, and can save you from putting a lot of work
into a contribution that is not suitable for the project.

## Contribution Suitability[¶](#contribution-suitability "Link to this heading")

Our project maintainers have the last word on whether or not a contribution is
suitable for Requests. All contributions will be considered carefully, but from
time to time, contributions will be rejected because they do not suit the
current goals or needs of the project.

If your contribution is rejected, don’t despair! As long as you followed these
guidelines, you will have a much better chance of getting your next
contribution accepted.

### Steps for Submitting Code[¶](#steps-for-submitting-code "Link to this heading")

When contributing code, you’ll want to follow this checklist:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Run the tests to confirm they all pass on your system. If they don’t, you’ll
   need to investigate why they fail. If you’re unable to diagnose this
   yourself, raise it as a bug report by following the guidelines in this
   document: [Bug Reports](#bug-reports).
3. Write tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that they fail.
4. Make your change.
5. Run the entire test suite again, confirming that all tests pass *including
   the ones you just added*.
6. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository’s `main` branch.
   GitHub Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this
   project.

The following sub-sections go into more detail on some of the points above.

### Code Review[¶](#code-review "Link to this heading")

Contributions will not be merged until they’ve been code reviewed. You should
implement any code review feedback unless you strongly object to it. In the
event that you object to the code review feedback, you should make your case
clearly and calmly. If, after doing so, the feedback is judged to still apply,
you must either apply the feedback or withdraw your contribution.

### Code Style[¶](#code-style "Link to this heading")

Requests uses a collection of tools to ensure the code base has a consistent
style as it grows. We have these orchestrated using a tool called
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). This can be installed locally and run over your changes prior
to opening a PR, and will also be run as part of the CI approval process
before a change is merged.

You can find the full list of formatting requirements specified in the
[.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml) at the top level directory of Requests.

### New Contributors[¶](#new-contributors "Link to this heading")

If you are new or relatively new to Open Source, welcome! Requests aims to
be a gentle introduction to the world of Open Source. If you’re concerned about
how best to contribute, please consider mailing a maintainer (listed above) and
asking for help.

Please also check the [Get Early Feedback](#early-feedback) section.

## Documentation Contributions[¶](#documentation-contributions "Link to this heading")

Documentation improvements are always welcome! The documentation files live in
the `docs/` directory of the codebase. They’re written in
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), and use [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html) to generate the full suite of
documentation.

When contributing documentation, please do your best to follow the style of the
documentation files. This means a soft-limit of 79 characters wide in your text
files and a semi-formal, yet friendly and approachable, prose style.

When presenting Python code, use single-quoted strings (`'hello'` instead of
`"hello"`).

## Bug Reports[¶](#bug-reports "Link to this heading")

Bug reports are hugely important! Before you raise one, though, please check
through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues), **both open and closed**, to confirm that the bug
hasn’t been reported before. Duplicate bug reports are a huge drain on the time
of other contributors, and should be avoided as much as possible.

## Feature Requests[¶](#feature-requests "Link to this heading")

Requests is in a perpetual feature freeze, only the BDFL can add or approve of
new features. The maintainers believe that Requests is a feature-complete
piece of software at this time.

One of the most important skills to have while maintaining a largely-used
open source project is learning the ability to say “no” to suggested changes,
while keeping an open ear and mind.

If you believe there is a feature missing, feel free to raise a feature
request, but please do be aware that the overwhelming likelihood is that your
feature request will not be accepted.

Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for
human beings. You are currently looking at the documentation of the
development release.
