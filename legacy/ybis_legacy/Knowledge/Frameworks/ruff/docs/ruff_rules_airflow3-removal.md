Derived from the **[Airflow](../#airflow-air)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for uses of deprecated Airflow functions and values.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Airflow 3.0 removed various deprecated functions, members, and other
values. Some have more modern replacements. Others are considered too niche
and not worth continued maintenance in Airflow.

## [Example](#example)

```
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago


yesterday = days_ago(today, 1)
```

Use instead:

```
from datetime import timedelta


yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
```
