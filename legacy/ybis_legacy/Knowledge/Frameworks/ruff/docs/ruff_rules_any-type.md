Derived from the **[flake8-annotations](../#flake8-annotations-ann)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that function arguments are annotated with a more specific type than
`Any`.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

`Any` is a special type indicating an unconstrained type. When an
expression is annotated with type `Any`, type checkers will allow all
operations on it.

It's better to be explicit about the type of an expression, and to use
`Any` as an "escape hatch" only when it is really needed.

## [Example](#example)

```
from typing import Any


def foo(x: Any): ...
```

Use instead:

```
def foo(x: int): ...
```

## [Known problems](#known-problems)

Type aliases are unsupported and can lead to false positives.
For example, the following will trigger this rule inadvertently:

```
from typing import Any

MyAny = Any


def foo(x: MyAny): ...
```
