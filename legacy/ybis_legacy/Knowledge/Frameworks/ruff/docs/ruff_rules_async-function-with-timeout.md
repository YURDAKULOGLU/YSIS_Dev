## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for `async` function definitions with `timeout` parameters.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Rather than implementing asynchronous timeout behavior manually, prefer
built-in timeout functionality, such as `asyncio.timeout`, `trio.fail_after`,
or `anyio.move_on_after`, among others.

This rule is highly opinionated to enforce a design pattern
called ["structured concurrency"](https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/#timeouts-and-cancellation) that allows for
`async` functions to be oblivious to timeouts,
instead letting callers to handle the logic with a context manager.

## [Details](#details)

This rule attempts to detect which async framework your code is using
by analysing the imports in the file it's checking. If it sees an
`anyio` import in your code, it will assume `anyio` is your framework
of choice; if it sees a `trio` import, it will assume `trio`; if it
sees neither, it will assume `asyncio`. `asyncio.timeout` was added
in Python 3.11, so if `asyncio` is detected as the framework being used,
this rule will be ignored when your configured [`target-version`](../../settings/#target-version) is set
to less than Python 3.11.

For functions that wrap `asyncio.timeout`, `trio.fail_after` or
`anyio.move_on_after`, false positives from this rule can be avoided
by using a different parameter name.

## [Example](#example)

```
async def long_running_task(timeout): ...


async def main():
    await long_running_task(timeout=2)
```

Use instead:

```
async def long_running_task(): ...


async def main():
    async with asyncio.timeout(2):
        await long_running_task()
```
