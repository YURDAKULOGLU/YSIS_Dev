Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for uses of `trio.sleep(0)` or `anyio.sleep(0)`.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

`trio.sleep(0)` is equivalent to calling `trio.lowlevel.checkpoint()`.
However, the latter better conveys the intent of the code.

## [Example](#example)

```
import trio


async def func():
    await trio.sleep(0)
```

Use instead:

```
import trio


async def func():
    await trio.lowlevel.checkpoint()
```

## [Fix safety](#fix-safety)

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there's comments in the
`trio.sleep(0)` expression, as comments may be removed.

For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case:

```
import trio


async def func():
    await trio.sleep(  # comment
        # comment
        0
    )
```
