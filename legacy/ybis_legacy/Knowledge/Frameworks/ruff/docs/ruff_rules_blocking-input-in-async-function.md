Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that async functions do not contain blocking usage of input from user.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Blocking an async function via a blocking input call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for user
input, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of making a blocking input call directly, wrap the input call in
an executor to execute the blocking call on another thread.

## [Example](#example)

```
async def foo():
    username = input("Username:")
```

Use instead:

```
import asyncio


async def foo():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    username = await loop.run_in_executor(None, input, "Username:")
```
