Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that async functions do not open files with blocking methods like `open`.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library
or function.

## [Example](#example)

```
async def foo():
    with open("bar.txt") as f:
        contents = f.read()
```

Use instead:

```
import anyio


async def foo():
    async with await anyio.open_file("bar.txt") as f:
        contents = await f.read()
```
