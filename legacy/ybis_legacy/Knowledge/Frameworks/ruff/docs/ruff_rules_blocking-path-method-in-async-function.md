Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

This rule is unstable and in [preview](../../preview/). The `--preview` flag is required for use.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that async functions do not call blocking `os.path` or `pathlib.Path`
methods.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Calling some `os.path` or `pathlib.Path` methods in an async function will block
the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting
for the operation. This negates the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead, use the methods' async equivalents from `trio.Path` or `anyio.Path`.

## [Example](#example)

```
import os


async def func():
    path = "my_file.txt"
    file_exists = os.path.exists(path)
```

Use instead:

```
import trio


async def func():
    path = trio.Path("my_file.txt")
    file_exists = await path.exists()
```

Non-blocking methods are OK to use:

```
import pathlib


async def func():
    path = pathlib.Path("my_file.txt")
    file_dirname = path.dirname()
    new_path = os.path.join("/tmp/src/", path)
```
