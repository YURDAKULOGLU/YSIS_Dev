Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that async functions do not call `time.sleep`.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Blocking an async function via a `time.sleep` call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
`time.sleep`, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of `time.sleep`, use `asyncio.sleep`.

## [Example](#example)

```
import time


async def fetch():
    time.sleep(1)
```

Use instead:

```
import asyncio


async def fetch():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
```
