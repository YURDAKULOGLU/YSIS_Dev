Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for timeout context managers which do not contain a checkpoint.

For the purposes of this check, `yield` is considered a checkpoint,
since checkpoints may occur in the caller to which we yield.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Some asynchronous context managers, such as `asyncio.timeout` and
`trio.move_on_after`, have no effect unless they contain a checkpoint.
The use of such context managers without an `await`, `async with` or
`async for` statement is likely a mistake.

## [Example](#example)

```
import asyncio


async def func():
    async with asyncio.timeout(2):
        do_something()
```

Use instead:

```
import asyncio


async def func():
    async with asyncio.timeout(2):
        do_something()
        await awaitable()
```
