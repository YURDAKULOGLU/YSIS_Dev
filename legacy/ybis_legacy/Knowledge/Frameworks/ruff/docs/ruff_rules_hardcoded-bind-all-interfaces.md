Derived from the **[flake8-bandit](../#flake8-bandit-s)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for hardcoded bindings to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Binding to all network interfaces is insecure as it allows access from
unintended interfaces, which may be poorly secured or unauthorized.

Instead, bind to specific interfaces.

## [Example](#example)

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["0.0.0.0"]
```

Use instead:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["127.0.0.1", "localhost"]
```
