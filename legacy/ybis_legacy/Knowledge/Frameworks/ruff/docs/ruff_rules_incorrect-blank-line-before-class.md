Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for docstrings on class definitions that are not preceded by a
blank line.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Use a blank line to separate the docstring from the class definition, for
consistency.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is disabled when using the `google`,
`numpy`, and `pep257` conventions.

For an alternative, see [D211](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/blank-line-before-class).

## [Example](#example)

```
class PhotoMetadata:
    """Metadata about a photo."""
```

Use instead:

```
class PhotoMetadata:

    """Metadata about a photo."""
```

## [Options](#options)
