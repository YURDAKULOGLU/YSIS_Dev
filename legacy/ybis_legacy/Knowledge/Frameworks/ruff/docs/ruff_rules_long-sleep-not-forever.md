Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for uses of `trio.sleep()` or `anyio.sleep()` with a delay greater than 24 hours.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Calling `sleep()` with a delay greater than 24 hours is usually intended
to sleep indefinitely. Instead of using a large delay,
`trio.sleep_forever()` or `anyio.sleep_forever()` better conveys the intent.

## [Example](#example)

```
import trio


async def func():
    await trio.sleep(86401)
```

Use instead:

```
import trio


async def func():
    await trio.sleep_forever()
```

## [Fix safety](#fix-safety)

This fix is marked as unsafe as it changes program behavior.
