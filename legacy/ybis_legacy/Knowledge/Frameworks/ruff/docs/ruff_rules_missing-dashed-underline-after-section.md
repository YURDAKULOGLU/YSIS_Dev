Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for section headers in docstrings that are not followed by
underlines.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

This rule enforces a consistent style for multiline numpy-style docstrings,
and helps prevent incorrect syntax in docstrings using reStructuredText.

Multiline numpy-style docstrings are typically composed of a summary line,
followed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections. Each section
has a section header and a section body, and the header should be followed
by a series of underline characters in the following line.

This rule enforces a consistent style for multiline numpy-style docstrings
with sections. If your docstring uses reStructuredText, the rule also
helps protect against incorrect reStructuredText syntax, which would cause
errors if you tried to use a tool such as Sphinx to generate documentation
from the docstring.

This rule is enabled when using the `numpy` convention, and disabled
when using the `google` or `pep257` conventions.

## [Example](#example)

```
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Parameters

    distance : float
        Distance traveled.
    time : float
        Time spent traveling.

    Returns

    float
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises

    FasterThanLightError
        If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```

Use instead:

```
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance : float
        Distance traveled.
    time : float
        Time spent traveling.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises
    ------
    FasterThanLightError
        If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```
