Derived from the **[flake8-annotations](../#flake8-annotations-ann)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that class methods have return type annotations.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Type annotations are a good way to document the return types of functions. They also
help catch bugs, when used alongside a type checker, by ensuring that the types of
any returned values, and the types expected by callers, match expectation.

## [Example](#example)

```
class Foo:
    @classmethod
    def bar(cls):
        return 1
```

Use instead:

```
class Foo:
    @classmethod
    def bar(cls) -> int:
        return 1
```
