Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

Fix is always available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for docstring section headers that do not end with a colon.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

This rule enforces a consistent style for multiline Google-style
docstrings. If a multiline Google-style docstring consists of multiple
sections, each section header should end with a colon.

Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by
a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header
and a section body.

This rule is enabled when using the `google` convention, and disabled when
using the `pep257` and `numpy` conventions.

## [Example](#example)

```
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```

Use instead:

```
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    """Calculate speed as distance divided by time.

    Args:
        distance: Distance traveled.
        time: Time spent traveling.

    Returns:
        Speed as distance divided by time.

    Raises:
        FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light.
    """
    try:
        return distance / time
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
        raise FasterThanLightError from exc
```
