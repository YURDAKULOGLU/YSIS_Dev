Derived from the **[pydocstyle](../#pydocstyle-d)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for docstring first lines that are not in an imperative mood.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

[PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) recommends that the first line of a docstring be written in the
imperative mood, for consistency.

Hint: to rewrite the docstring in the imperative, phrase the first line as
if it were a command.

This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of
convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the `numpy` and
`pep257` conventions, and disabled when using the `google` conventions.

## [Example](#example)

```
def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """Returns the mean of the given values."""
```

Use instead:

```
def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
    """Return the mean of the given values."""
```
