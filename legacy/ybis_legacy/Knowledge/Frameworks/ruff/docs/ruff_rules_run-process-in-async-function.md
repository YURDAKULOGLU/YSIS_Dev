Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that async functions do not run processes with blocking methods.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library
or function, like [`trio.run_process()`](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-io.html#trio.run_process)
or [`anyio.run_process()`](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#anyio.run_process).

## [Example](#example)

```
import subprocess


async def foo():
    subprocess.run(cmd)
```

Use instead:

```
import asyncio


async def foo():
    asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(cmd)
```
