## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for uses of `six.PY3`.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

`six.PY3` will evaluate to `False` on Python 4 and greater. This is likely
unintended, and may cause code intended to run on Python 2 to run on Python 4
too.

Instead, use `not six.PY2` to validate that the current Python major version is
*not* equal to 2, to future-proof the code.

## [Example](#example)

```
import six

six.PY3  # `False` on Python 4.
```

Use instead:

```
import six

not six.PY2  # `True` on Python 4.
```
