## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for calls to `marshal` functions.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Deserializing untrusted data with `marshal` is insecure, as it can allow for
the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve
arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.

Avoid deserializing untrusted data with `marshal`. Instead, consider safer
formats, such as JSON.

If you must deserialize untrusted data with `marshal`, consider signing the
data with a secret key and verifying the signature before deserializing the
payload. This will prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary objects
into the serialized data.

In [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/), this rule will also flag references to `marshal` functions.

## [Example](#example)

```
import marshal

with open("foo.marshal", "rb") as file:
    foo = marshal.load(file)
```

Use instead:

```
import json

with open("foo.json", "rb") as file:
    foo = json.load(file)
```
