Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for calls to trio functions that are not immediately awaited.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Many of the functions exposed by trio are asynchronous, and must be awaited
to take effect. Calling a trio function without an `await` can lead to
`RuntimeWarning` diagnostics and unexpected behaviour.

## [Example](#example)

```
import trio


async def double_sleep(x):
    trio.sleep(2 * x)
```

Use instead:

```
import trio


async def double_sleep(x):
    await trio.sleep(2 * x)
```

## [Fix safety](#fix-safety)

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as adding an `await` to a function
call changes its semantics and runtime behavior.
