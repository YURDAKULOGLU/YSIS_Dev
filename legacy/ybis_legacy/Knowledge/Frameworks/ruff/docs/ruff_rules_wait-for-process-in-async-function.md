Derived from the **[flake8-async](../#flake8-async-async)** linter.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks that async functions do not wait on processes with blocking methods.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire
event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the
call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library
or function, like [`trio.to_thread.run_sync()`](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-core.html#trio.to_thread.run_sync)
or [`anyio.to_thread.run_sync()`](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#anyio.to_thread.run_sync).

## [Example](#example)

```
import os


async def foo():
    os.waitpid(0)
```

Use instead:

```
import asyncio
import os


def wait_for_process():
    os.waitpid(0)


async def foo():
    await asyncio.loop.run_in_executor(None, wait_for_process)
```
