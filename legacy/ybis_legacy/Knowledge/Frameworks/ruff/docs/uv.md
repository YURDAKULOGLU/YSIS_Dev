*Installing [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/)'s dependencies with a warm cache.*

## [Highlights](#highlights)

* 🚀 A single tool to replace `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, `twine`, `virtualenv`,
  and more.
* ⚡️ [10-100x faster](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md) than `pip`.
* 🗂️ Provides [comprehensive project management](#projects), with a
  [universal lockfile](concepts/projects/layout/#the-lockfile).
* ❇️ [Runs scripts](#scripts), with support for
  [inline dependency metadata](guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies).
* 🐍 [Installs and manages](#python-versions) Python versions.
* 🛠️ [Runs and installs](#tools) tools published as Python packages.
* 🔩 Includes a [pip-compatible interface](#the-pip-interface) for a performance boost with a
  familiar CLI.
* 🏢 Supports Cargo-style [workspaces](concepts/projects/workspaces/) for scalable projects.
* 💾 Disk-space efficient, with a [global cache](concepts/cache/) for dependency deduplication.
* ⏬ Installable without Rust or Python via `curl` or `pip`.
* 🖥️ Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

uv is backed by [Astral](https://astral.sh), the creators of
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## [Installation](#installation)

Install uv with our official standalone installer:

macOS and LinuxWindows

```
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```
PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then, check out the [first steps](getting-started/first-steps/) or read on for a brief overview.

Tip

uv may also be installed with pip, Homebrew, and more. See all of the methods on the
[installation page](getting-started/installation/).

## [Projects](#projects)

uv manages project dependencies and environments, with support for lockfiles, workspaces, and more,
similar to `rye` or `poetry`:

```
$ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/home/user/example`

$ cd example

$ uv add ruff
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 170ms
   Built example @ file:///home/user/example
Prepared 2 packages in 627ms
Installed 2 packages in 1ms
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///home/user/example)
 + ruff==0.5.4

$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!

$ uv lock
Resolved 2 packages in 0.33ms

$ uv sync
Resolved 2 packages in 0.70ms
Audited 1 package in 0.02ms
```

See the [project guide](guides/projects/) to get started.

uv also supports building and publishing projects, even if they're not managed with uv. See the
[packaging guide](guides/package/) to learn more.

## [Scripts](#scripts)

uv manages dependencies and environments for single-file scripts.

Create a new script and add inline metadata declaring its dependencies:

```
$ echo 'import requests; print(requests.get("https://astral.sh"))' > example.py

$ uv add --script example.py requests
Updated `example.py`
```

Then, run the script in an isolated virtual environment:

```
$ uv run example.py
Reading inline script metadata from: example.py
Installed 5 packages in 12ms
<Response [200]>
```

See the [scripts guide](guides/scripts/) to get started.

## [Tools](#tools)

uv executes and installs command-line tools provided by Python packages, similar to `pipx`.

Run a tool in an ephemeral environment using `uvx` (an alias for `uv tool run`):

```
$ uvx pycowsay 'hello world!'
Resolved 1 package in 167ms
Installed 1 package in 9ms
 + pycowsay==0.0.0.2
  """

  ------------
< hello world! >
  ------------
   \   ^__^
    \  (oo)\_______
       (__)\       )\/\
           ||----w |
           ||     ||
```

Install a tool with `uv tool install`:

```
$ uv tool install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 6ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.5.4
Installed 1 executable: ruff

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.4
```

See the [tools guide](guides/tools/) to get started.

## [Python versions](#python-versions)

uv installs Python and allows quickly switching between versions.

Install multiple Python versions:

```
$ uv python install 3.10 3.11 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.11
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Installed 3 versions in 3.42s
 + cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none
```

Download Python versions as needed:

```
$ uv venv --python 3.12.0
Using CPython 3.12.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate

$ uv run --python [email protected] -- python
Python 3.8.16 (a9dbdca6fc3286b0addd2240f11d97d8e8de187a, Dec 29 2022, 11:45:30)
[PyPy 7.3.11 with GCC Apple LLVM 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>>
```

Use a specific Python version in the current directory:

```
$ uv python pin 3.11
Pinned `.python-version` to `3.11`
```

See the [installing Python guide](guides/install-python/) to get started.

## [The pip interface](#the-pip-interface)

uv provides a drop-in replacement for common `pip`, `pip-tools`, and `virtualenv` commands.

uv extends their interfaces with advanced features, such as dependency version overrides,
platform-independent resolutions, reproducible resolutions, alternative resolution strategies, and
more.

Migrate to uv without changing your existing workflows — and experience a 10-100x speedup — with the
`uv pip` interface.

Compile requirements into a platform-independent requirements file:

```
$ uv pip compile docs/requirements.in \
   --universal \
   --output-file docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 12ms
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
$ uv venv
Using CPython 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the locked requirements:

```
$ uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt
Resolved 43 packages in 11ms
Installed 43 packages in 208ms
 + babel==2.15.0
 + black==24.4.2
 + certifi==2024.7.4
 ...
```

See the [pip interface documentation](pip/) to get started.
