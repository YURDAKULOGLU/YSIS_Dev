Temporal Client - Python SDK | Temporal Platform Documentation



[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the Temporal Service.
Communication with a Temporal Service lets you perform actions such as starting Workflow Executions, sending Signals and
Queries to Workflow Executions, getting Workflow results, and more.

This page shows you how to do the following using the Python SDK with the Temporal Client:

* [Connect to a local development Temporal Service](#connect-to-development-service)
* [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
* [Start a Workflow Execution](#start-workflow-execution)
* [Get Workflow results](#get-workflow-results)

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow. However, it is acceptable and common to use a
Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Service.

## Connect to development Temporal Service[​](#connect-to-development-service "Direct link to Connect to development Temporal Service")

Use [`Client.connect`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#connect) to create a client. Connection
options include the Temporal Server address, Namespace, and (optionally) TLS configuration. You can provide these
options directly in code, load them from **environment variables**, or a **TOML configuration file** using the
[`envconfig`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.envconfig.html) helpers. We recommend environment variables or a
configuration file for secure, repeatable configuration.

When you’re running a Temporal Service locally (such as with the
[Temporal CLI dev server](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev)), the required options are minimal. If you
don't specify a host/port, most connections default to `127.0.0.1:7233` and the `default` Namespace.

* Configuration File* Environment Variables* Code

You can use a TOML configuration file to set connection options for the Temporal Client. The configuration file lets you
configure multiple profiles, each with its own set of connection options. You can then specify which profile to use when
creating the Temporal Client. You can use the environment variable `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` to specify the location of the
TOML file or provide the path to the file directly in code. If you don't provide the configuration file path, the SDK
looks for it at the path `~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml` or the equivalent on your OS. Refer to
[Environment Configuration](/develop/environment-configuration#configuration-methods) for more details about configuration
files and profiles.

info

The connection options set in configuration files have lower precedence than environment variables. This means that if
you set the same option in both the configuration file and as an environment variable, the environment variable value
overrides the option set in the configuration file.

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines two profiles: `default` and `prod`. Each profile has its own
set of connection options.

config.toml

```
# Default profile for local development  
[profile.default]  
address = "localhost:7233"  
namespace = "default"  
  
# Optional: Add custom gRPC headers  
[profile.default.grpc_meta]  
my-custom-header = "development-value"  
trace-id = "dev-trace-123"  
  
# Production profile for Temporal Cloud  
[profile.prod]  
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"  
namespace = "your-namespace"  
api_key = "your-api-key-here"  
  
# TLS configuration for production  
[profile.prod.tls]  
# TLS auto-enables when TLS config or an API key is present  
# disabled = false  
client_cert_path = "/etc/temporal/certs/client.pem"  
client_key_path  = "/etc/temporal/certs/client.key"  
  
# Custom headers for production  
[profile.prod.grpc_meta]  
environment     = "production"  
service-version = "v1.2.3"
```

You can create a Temporal Client using a profile from the configuration file using the
`ClientConfig.load_client_connect_config` function as follows. In this example, you load the `default` profile for local
development:

```
import asyncio  
from pathlib import Path  
  
from temporalio.client import Client  
from temporalio.envconfig import ClientConfig  
  
  
async def main():  
    """  
    Loads the default profile from the config.toml file in this directory.  
    """  
    print("--- Loading default profile from config.toml ---")  
  
    # For this sample to be self-contained, we explicitly provide the path to  
    # the config.toml file included in this directory.  
    # By default though, the config.toml file will be loaded from  
    # ~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml (or the equivalent standard config directory on your OS).  
    config_file = Path(__file__).parent / "config.toml"  
  
    # load_client_connect_config is a helper that loads a profile and prepares  
    # the config dictionary for Client.connect. By default, it loads the  
    # "default" profile.  
    connect_config = ClientConfig.load_client_connect_config(  
        config_file=str(config_file)  
    )  
  
    print(f"Loaded 'default' profile from {config_file}.")  
    print(f"  Address: {connect_config.get('target_host')}")  
    print(f"  Namespace: {connect_config.get('namespace')}")  
    print(f"  gRPC Metadata: {connect_config.get('rpc_metadata')}")  
  
    print("\nAttempting to connect to client...")  
    try:  
        await Client.connect(**connect_config)  # type: ignore  
        print("✅ Client connected successfully!")  
    except Exception as e:  
        print(f"❌ Failed to connect: {e}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Use the `envconfig` package to set connection options for the Temporal Client using environment variables. For a list of
all available environment variables and their default values, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

For example, the following code snippet loads all environment variables and creates a Temporal Client with the options
specified in those variables. If you have defined a configuration file at either the default location
(`~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`) or a custom location specified by the `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable, this will also load the default profile in the configuration file. However, any options set via environment
variables will take precedence.

Set the following environment variables before running your Python application. Replace the placeholder values with your
actual configuration. Since this is for a local development Temporal Service, the values connect to `localhost:7233` and
the `default` Namespace. You may omit these variables entirely since they're the defaults.

```
export TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE="default"  
export TEMPORAL_ADDRESS="localhost:7233"
```

After setting the environment variables, you can create a Temporal Client as follows:

```
import asyncio  
from pathlib import Path  
  
from temporalio.client import Client  
from temporalio.envconfig import ClientConfig  
  
async def main():  
    # load_client_connect_config is a helper that loads a profile and prepares  
    # the config dictionary for Client.connect. By default, it loads the  
    # "default" profile.  
    connect_config = ClientConfig.load_client_connect_config()  
  
    print(f"  Address: {connect_config.get('target_host')}")  
    print(f"  Namespace: {connect_config.get('namespace')}")  
    print(f"  gRPC Metadata: {connect_config.get('rpc_metadata')}")  
  
    print("\nAttempting to connect to client...")  
    try:  
        await Client.connect(**connect_config)  # type: ignore  
        print("✅ Client connected successfully!")  
    except Exception as e:  
        print(f"❌ Failed to connect: {e}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

If you don't want to use environment variables or a configuration file, you can specify connection options directly in
code. This is convenient for local development and testing. You can also load a base configuration from environment
variables or a configuration file, and then override specific options in code.

Use the `connect()` method on the `Client` class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Service.

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
# ...  
async def main():  
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")  
  
    result = await client.execute_workflow(  
        YourWorkflow.run,  
        "your name",  
        id="your-workflow-id",  
        task_queue="your-task-queue",  
    )  
  
    print(f"Result: {result}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Connect to Temporal Cloud[​](#connect-to-temporal-cloud "Direct link to Connect to Temporal Cloud")

You can connect to Temporal Cloud using either an [API key](/cloud/api-keys) or through mTLS. Connection to Temporal
Cloud or any secured Temporal Service requires additional connection options compared to connecting to an unsecured
local development instance:

* Your credentials for authentication.
  + If you are using an API key, provide the API key value.
  + If you are using mTLS, provide the mTLS CA certificate and mTLS private key.
* Your *Namespace and Account ID* combination, which follows the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
* The *endpoint* may vary. The most common endpoint used is the gRPC regional endpoint, which follows the format:
  `<region>.<cloud_provider>.api.temporal.io:7233`.
* For Namespaces with High Availability features with API key authentication enabled, use the gRPC Namespace endpoint:
  `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`. This allows automated failover without needing to switch endpoints.

You can find the Namespace and Account ID, as well as the endpoint, on the Namespaces tab:

![The Namespace and Account ID combination on the left, and the regional endpoint on the right](/assets/images/namespaces-and-regional-endpoints-5d0328eb623fc5e3307226a01a5f35b1.png)

You can provide these connection options using environment variables, a configuration file, or directly in code.

* Configuration File* Environment Variables* Code

You can use a TOML configuration file to set connection options for the Temporal Client. The configuration file lets you
configure multiple profiles, each with its own set of connection options. You can then specify which profile to use when
creating the Temporal Client. For a list of all available configuration options you can set in the TOML file, refer to
[Environment Configuration](/references/client-environment-configuration).

You can use the environment variable `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` to specify the location of the TOML file or provide the path
to the file directly in code. If you don't provide the path to the configuration file, the SDK looks for it at the
default path `~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`.

info

The connection options set in configuration files have lower precedence than environment variables. This means that if
you set the same option in both the configuration file and as an environment variable, the environment variable value
overrides the option set in the configuration file.

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines a `staing` profile with the necessary connection options to
connect to Temporal Cloud via an API key:

For example, the following TOML configuration file defines a `staging` profile with the necessary connection options to
connect to Temporal Cloud via an API key:

```
# Cloud profile for Temporal Cloud  
[profile.staging]  
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"  
namespace = "your-namespace"  
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
```

If you want to use mTLS authentication instead of an API key, replace the `api_key` field with your mTLS certificate and
private key:

```
# Cloud profile for Temporal Cloud  
[profile.staging]  
address = "your-namespace.a1b2c.tmprl.cloud:7233"  
namespace = "your-namespace"  
tls_client_cert_data = "your-tls-client-cert-data"  
tls_client_key_path = "your-tls-client-key-path"
```

With the connections options defined in the configuration file, use the
[`connect` method](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#connect) on the `Client` class to create a
Temporal Client using the `staging` profile as follows. After loading the profile, you can also programmatically
override specific connection options before creating the client.

```
import asyncio  
from pathlib import Path  
  
from temporalio.client import Client  
from temporalio.envconfig import ClientConfig  
  
  
async def main():  
    """  
    Demonstrates loading a named profile and overriding values programmatically.  
    """  
    print("--- Loading 'staging' profile with programmatic overrides ---")  
  
    config_file = Path(__file__).parent / "config.toml"  
    profile_name = "staging"  
  
    print(  
        "The 'staging' profile in config.toml has an incorrect address (localhost:9999)."  
    )  
    print("We'll programmatically override it to the correct address.")  
  
    # Load the 'staging' profile.  
    connect_config = ClientConfig.load_client_connect_config(  
        profile=profile_name,  
        config_file=str(config_file),  
    )  
  
    # Override the target host to the correct address.  
    # This is the recommended way to override configuration values.  
    connect_config["target_host"] = "localhost:7233"  
  
    print(f"\nLoaded '{profile_name}' profile from {config_file} with overrides.")  
    print(  
        f"  Address: {connect_config.get('target_host')} (overridden from localhost:9999)"  
    )  
    print(f"  Namespace: {connect_config.get('namespace')}")  
  
    print("\nAttempting to connect to client...")  
    try:  
        await Client.connect(**connect_config)  # type: ignore  
        print("✅ Client connected successfully!")  
    except Exception as e:  
        print(f"❌ Failed to connect: {e}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The following environment variables are required to connect to Temporal Cloud:

* `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`: Your Namespace and Account ID combination in the format `<namespace_id>.<account_id>`.
* `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`: The gRPC endpoint for your Temporal Cloud Namespace.
* `TEMPORAL_API_KEY`: Your API key value. Required if you are using API key authentication.
* `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_DATA` or `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`: Your mTLS client certificate data or file path.
  Required if you are using mTLS authentication.
* `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_DATA` or `TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`: Your mTLS client private key data or file path.
  Required if you are using mTLS authentication.

Ensure these environment variables exist in your environment before running your Python application.

Import the `EnvConfig` package to set connection options for the Temporal Client using environment variables. The
`MustLoadDefaultClientOptions` function will automatically load all environment variables. For a list of all available
environment variables and their default values, refer to [Environment Configuration](/develop/environment-configuration).

For example, the following code snippet loads all environment variables and creates a Temporal Client with the options
specified in those variables. If you have defined a configuration file at either the default location
(`~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`) or a custom location specified by the `TEMPORAL_CONFIG_FILE` environment
variable, this will also load the default profile in the configuration file. However, any options set via environment
variables will take precedence.

After setting the environment variables, use the following code to create the Temporal Client:

```
import asyncio  
from pathlib import Path  
  
from temporalio.client import Client  
from temporalio.envconfig import ClientConfig  
  
async def main():  
    # load_client_connect_config is a helper that loads a profile and prepares  
    # the config dictionary for Client.connect. By default, it loads the  
    # "default" profile.  
    connect_config = ClientConfig.load_client_connect_config()  
  
    print(f"  Address: {connect_config.get('target_host')}")  
    print(f"  Namespace: {connect_config.get('namespace')}")  
    print(f"  gRPC Metadata: {connect_config.get('rpc_metadata')}")  
  
    print("\nAttempting to connect to client...")  
    try:  
        await Client.connect(**connect_config)  # type: ignore  
        print("✅ Client connected successfully!")  
    except Exception as e:  
        print(f"❌ Failed to connect: {e}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

You can also specify connection options directly in code to connect to Temporal Cloud. To create an initial connection,
provide the endpoint, Namespace and Account ID combination, and API key values to the `Client.connect` method.

```
client = await Client.connect(  
    <endpoint>,  
    namespace=<namespace_id>.<account_id>,  
    api_key=<APIKey>,  
    tls=True,  
)
```

To connect using mTLS instead of an API key, provide the mTLS certificate and private key as follows:

[View the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py)

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
from temporalio.client import Client, TLSConfig  
# ...  
# ...  
async def main():  
    with open("client-cert.pem", "rb") as f:  
        client_cert = f.read()  
    with open("client-private-key.pem", "rb") as f:  
        client_private_key = f.read()  
    client = await Client.connect(  
        "your-custom-namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233",  
        namespace="<your-custom-namespace>.<account-id>",  
        tls=TLSConfig(  
            client_cert=client_cert,  
            client_private_key=client_private_key,  
            # domain=domain, # TLS domain  
            # server_root_ca_cert=server_root_ca_cert, # ROOT CA to validate the server cert  
        ),  
    )
```

## Start a Workflow Execution[​](#start-workflow-execution "Direct link to Start a Workflow Execution")

**How to start a Workflow Execution using the Python SDK**

[Workflow Execution](/workflow-execution) semantics rely on several parameters—that is, to start a Workflow Execution
you must supply a Task Queue that will be used for the Tasks (one that a Worker is polling), the Workflow Type,
language-specific contextual data, and Workflow Function parameters.

In the examples below, all Workflow Executions are started using a Temporal Client. To spawn Workflow Executions from
within another Workflow Execution, use either the [Child Workflow](/develop/python/child-workflows) or External Workflow
APIs.

See the [Customize Workflow Type](/develop/python/core-application#workflow-type) section to see how to customize the
name of the Workflow Type.

A request to spawn a Workflow Execution causes the Temporal Service to create the first Event
([WorkflowExecutionStarted](/references/events#workflowexecutionstarted)) in the Workflow Execution Event History. The
Temporal Service then creates the first Workflow Task, resulting in the first
[WorkflowTaskScheduled](/references/events#workflowtaskscheduled) Event.

To start a Workflow Execution in Python, use either the
[`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or
[`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) asynchronous methods
in the Client.

[View the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py)

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
# ...  
async def main():  
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")  
  
    result = await client.execute_workflow(  
        YourWorkflow.run,  
        "your name",  
        id="your-workflow-id",  
        task_queue="your-task-queue",  
    )  
  
    print(f"Result: {result}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Set a Workflow's Task Queue[​](#set-task-queue "Direct link to Set a Workflow's Task Queue")

**How to set a Workflow's Task Queue using the Python SDK**

In most SDKs, the only Workflow Option that must be set is the name of the [Task Queue](/task-queue).

For any code to execute, a Worker Process must be running that contains a Worker Entity that is polling the same Task
Queue name.

To set a Task Queue in Python, specify the `task_queue` argument when executing a Workflow with either
[`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or
[`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) methods.

[View the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py)

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
# ...  
async def main():  
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")  
  
    result = await client.execute_workflow(  
        YourWorkflow.run,  
        "your name",  
        id="your-workflow-id",  
        task_queue="your-task-queue",  
    )  
  
    print(f"Result: {result}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Set a Workflow Id[​](#workflow-id "Direct link to Set a Workflow Id")

**How to set a Workflow Id using the Python SDK**

You must set a [Workflow Id](/workflow-execution/workflowid-runid#workflow-id).

When setting a Workflow Id, we recommended mapping it to a business process or business entity identifier, such as an
order identifier or customer identifier.

To set a Workflow Id in Python, specify the `id` argument when executing a Workflow with either
[`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or
[`execute_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#execute_workflow) methods.

The `id` argument should be a unique identifier for the Workflow Execution.

[View the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py)

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
# ...  
async def main():  
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")  
  
    result = await client.execute_workflow(  
        YourWorkflow.run,  
        "your name",  
        id="your-workflow-id",  
        task_queue="your-task-queue",  
    )  
  
    print(f"Result: {result}")  
  
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Get the results of a Workflow Execution[​](#get-workflow-results "Direct link to Get the results of a Workflow Execution")

**How to get the results of a Workflow Execution using the Python SDK**

If the call to start a Workflow Execution is successful, you will gain access to the Workflow Execution's Run Id.

The Workflow Id, Run Id, and Namespace may be used to uniquely identify a Workflow Execution in the system and get its
result.

It's possible to both block progress on the result (synchronous execution) or get the result at some other point in time
(asynchronous execution).

In the Temporal Platform, it's also acceptable to use Queries as the preferred method for accessing the state and
results of Workflow Executions.

Use [`start_workflow()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#start_workflow) or
[`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle) to return a
Workflow handle. Then use the [`result`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#result) method
to await on the result of the Workflow.

To get a handle for an existing Workflow by its Id, you can use
[`get_workflow_handle()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle), or use
[`get_workflow_handle_for()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.Client.html#get_workflow_handle_for) for type
safety.

Then use [`describe()`](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#describe) to get the current
status of the Workflow. If the Workflow does not exist, this call fails.

    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")  
  
    handle = client.get_workflow_handle(  
        workflow_id="your-workflow-id",  
    )  
    results = await handle.result()  
    print(f"Result: {results}")
