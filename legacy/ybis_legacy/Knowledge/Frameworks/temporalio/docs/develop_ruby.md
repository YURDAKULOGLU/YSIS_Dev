## [Core Application](/develop/ruby/core-application)[​](#core-application "Direct link to core-application")

Use the essential components of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers) to build and run a Temporal
application.

* [Develop a basic Workflow Definition](/develop/ruby/core-application#develop-workflow): Workflows are the fundamental
  unit of a Temporal Application, and it all starts with the development of a Workflow Definition.
