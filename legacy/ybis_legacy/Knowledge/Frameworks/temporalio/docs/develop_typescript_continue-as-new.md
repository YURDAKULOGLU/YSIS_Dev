## What is Continue-As-New?[​](#what "Direct link to What is Continue-As-New?")

[Continue-As-New](/workflow-execution/continue-as-new) lets a Workflow Execution close successfully and creates a new Workflow Execution.
You can think of it as a checkpoint when your Workflow gets too long or approaches certain scaling limits.

The new Workflow Execution is in the same [chain](/workflow-execution#workflow-execution-chain); it keeps the same Workflow Id but gets a new Run Id and a fresh Event History.
It also receives your Workflow's usual parameters.

## How to Continue-As-New using the Typescript SDK[​](#how "Direct link to How to Continue-As-New using the Typescript SDK")

First, design your Workflow parameters so that you can pass in the "current state" when you Continue-As-New into the next Workflow run.
This state is typically set to `None` for the original caller of the Workflow.

[View the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/message-passing/safe-message-handlers/src/workflows.ts)

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
export interface ClusterManagerInput {  
  state?: ClusterManagerState;  
}  
  
export async function clusterManagerWorkflow(input: ClusterManagerInput = {}): Promise<ClusterManagerStateSummary> {
```

The test hook in the above snippet is covered [below](#how-to-test).

Inside your Workflow, call the [`continueAsNew()`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#continueasnew) function with the same type.
This stops the Workflow right away and starts a new one.

[View the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/message-passing/safe-message-handlers/src/workflows.ts)

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
return await wf.continueAsNew<typeof clusterManagerWorkflow>({   
  state: manager.getState(),  
  testContinueAsNew: input.testContinueAsNew   
});
```

### Considerations for Workflows with Message Handlers[​](#with-message-handlers "Direct link to Considerations for Workflows with Message Handlers")

If you use Updates or Signals, don't call Continue-as-New from the handlers.
Instead, wait for your handlers to finish in your main Workflow before you run `ContinueAsNew`.
See the [`allHandlersFinished`](/develop/typescript/message-passing#wait-for-message-handlers) example for guidance.

## When is it right to Continue-as-New using the Typescript SDK?[​](#when "Direct link to When is it right to Continue-as-New using the Typescript SDK?")

Use Continue-as-New when your Workflow might hit [Event History Limits](/workflow-execution/event#event-history).

Temporal tracks your Workflow's progress against these limits to let you know when you should Continue-as-New.
Call `wf.workflowInfo().continueAsNewSuggested` to check if it's time.

## How to test Continue-as-New using the Typescript SDK[​](#how-to-test "Direct link to How to test Continue-as-New using the Typescript SDK")

Testing Workflows that naturally Continue-as-New may be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
Instead, add a test hook to check your Workflow's Continue-as-New behavior faster in automated tests.

For example, when `testContinueAsNew == true`, this sample creates a test-only variable called `this.maxHistoryLength` and sets it to a small value.
A helper method in the Workflow checks it each time it considers using Continue-as-New:

[View the source code](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/message-passing/safe-message-handlers/src/client.ts)

in the context of the rest of the application code.

```
shouldContinueAsNew(): boolean {  
  if (wf.workflowInfo().continueAsNewSuggested) {  
    return true;  
  }  
  
  // This is just for ease-of-testing. In production, we trust temporal to tell us when to continue-as-new.  
  if (this.maxHistoryLength !== undefined && wf.workflowInfo().historyLength > this.maxHistoryLength) {  
    return true;  
  }  
  
  return false;  
}
```
