Temporal Events reference | Temporal Platform Documentation



[Skip to main content](#__docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

[Events](/workflow-execution/event#event) are created by the [Temporal Service](/temporal-service) in response to external occurrences and [Commands](/workflow-execution#command) generated by a [Workflow Execution](/workflow-execution).
All possible Events that could appear in a Workflow Execution [Event History](/workflow-execution/event#event-history) are listed below.

### WorkflowExecutionStarted[​](#workflowexecutionstarted "Direct link to WorkflowExecutionStarted")

This is always the first [Event](/workflow-execution/event#event) in a Workflow Execution Event History.
It indicates that the Temporal Service received a request to spawn the Workflow Execution.

Note these headers are not the same as Temporal headers on internal activities and child Workflows, these are transmitted to Nexus operations that may be external and are not traditional payloads.|  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | workflow\_task\_completed\_event\_id The ID of the [WorkflowTaskCompleted](#workflowtaskcompleted) event that the corresponding ScheduleNexusOperation command was reported with.| request\_id A unique ID generated by the History Service upon creation of this event. The ID will be transmitted with all Nexus StartOperation requests and is used as an idempotency key.|  |  | | --- | --- | | endpoint\_id Endpoint ID as resolved in the endpoint registry at the time this event was generated. This is stored on the event and used internally by the server in case the endpoint is renamed from the time the event was originally scheduled. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

### NexusOperationStarted[​](#nexusoperationstarted "Direct link to NexusOperationStarted")

This Event type indicates that a Nexus Operation Execution was started.
This Event is added to the caller's Workflow History for Asynchronous Nexus Operations, for example those that are backed by a Workflow.
The Event is not added to the caller's Workflow History for Synchronous Nexus Operations, since they transition directly to [NexusOperationCompleted](#nexusoperationcompleted) or another final state such as [NexusOperationFailed](#nexusoperationfailed) when the response is provided synchronously by the Nexus handler.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field Description|  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | scheduled\_event\_id The ID of the [NexusOperationScheduled](#nexusoperationscheduled) event this task corresponds to.| operation\_token The operation token returned by the Nexus handler in the response to the StartOperation request. This token is used when canceling the operation.|  |  | | --- | --- | | request\_id The request ID allocated at schedule time. | | | | | | | |

### NexusOperationCompleted[​](#nexusoperationcompleted "Direct link to NexusOperationCompleted")

This Event type indicates that a Nexus Operation has completed successfully.
The caller's Workflow History records the result of a successful Nexus Operation with this event for synchronous and asynchronous Nexus Operations.
This Event type contains Nexus Operation results.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field Description|  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | scheduled\_event\_id The ID of the [NexusOperationScheduled](#nexusoperationscheduled) event. Uniquely identifies this operation.| result Serialized result of the Nexus operation. The response of the Nexus handler. Delivered either via a completion callback or as a response to a synchronous operation.|  |  | | --- | --- | | request\_id The request ID allocated at schedule time. | | | | | | | |

### NexusOperationFailed[​](#nexusoperationfailed "Direct link to NexusOperationFailed")

This Event type indicates that a Nexus Operation has failed.
The caller's Workflow History records a failed Nexus Operation with this event both for synchronous and asynchronous Nexus Operations.
For example, when a Nexus Handler responds synchronously with a non-retryable error or when a Workflow that backs an Operation fails, resulting in a [WorkflowExecutionFailed](#workflowexecutionfailed) Event.
When an SDK client picks up a Nexus Operation, the Nexus handler asynchronously starts an underlying Workflow, which subsequently results in [WorkflowExecutionFailed](#workflowexecutionfailed).
This Event type contains a Nexus Operation failure.

A NexusOperationFailureInfo wrapping an ApplicationFailureInfo.|  |  | | --- | --- | | request\_id The request ID allocated at schedule time. | | | | | | | |

### NexusOperationTimedOut[​](#nexusoperationtimedout "Direct link to NexusOperationTimedOut")

This Event type indicates that a Nexus Operation has timed out according to the Temporal Server, due to one of these Nexus Operation timeouts: Schedule-to-Close Timeout.

A NexusOperationFailureInfo wrapping a CanceledFailureInfo.|  |  | | --- | --- | | request\_id The request ID allocated at schedule time. | | | | | | | |

### NexusOperationCancelRequested[​](#nexusoperationcancelrequested "Direct link to NexusOperationCancelRequested")

This Event type indicates that the Workflow that scheduled a Nexus Operation requested to cancel it.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field Description|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | scheduled\_event\_id The id of the [NexusOperationScheduled](#nexusoperationscheduled)` event this cancel request corresponds to.| workflow\_task\_completed\_event\_id The [WorkflowTaskCompleted](#workflowtaskcompleted) event that the corresponding RequestCancelNexusOperation command was reported with. | | | | | |

### NexusOperationCanceled[​](#nexusoperationcanceled "Direct link to NexusOperationCanceled")

This Event type indicates that a Nexus Operation has resolved as canceled.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field Description|  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | scheduled\_event\_id The ID of the [NexusOperationScheduled](#nexusoperationscheduled)` event.
