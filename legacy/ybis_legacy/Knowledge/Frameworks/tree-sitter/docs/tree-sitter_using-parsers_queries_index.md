# [Pattern Matching with Queries](#pattern-matching-with-queries)

Code analysis often requires finding specific patterns in source code. Tree-sitter provides a simple pattern-matching
language for this purpose, similar to what's used in its [unit test system](../../creating-parsers/5-writing-tests.html).
This allows you to express and search for code structures without writing complex parsing logic.
