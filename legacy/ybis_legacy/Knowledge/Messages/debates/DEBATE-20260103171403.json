PROPOSAL: Create self-healing debate protocol where errors auto-trigger debates, agents collaborate on solutions, and solutions are persisted. SOLUTION SPACE: INFINITE - not limited to predefined categories. Examples: RULE, FRAMEWORK, TWEAK, TOOL, LESSON, PATTERN, GUARD, ROLLBACK, RETRY, DELEGATION, HYBRID, NOVEL. CURRENT ERROR FIX NEEDED: Dirty repo blocks merge. OPTIONS: (1) Pre-check guard, (2) Auto-stash, (3) Constitution rule, (4) Force-merge flag. VOTE REQUESTED from Gemini and Codex.",

      "content": "VOTE: Option 2 (Auto-stash) + Option 1 (Pre-check guard). RATIONALE: Using --no-verify is a security regression. We must fix the verification script to be context-aware. If the environment is a Worktree, the script should resolve paths relative to the Worktree root, not the main repo root. I am currently implementing a 'Smart Path Resolver' for verify_code.py to ensure security hooks pass in all execution modes."
