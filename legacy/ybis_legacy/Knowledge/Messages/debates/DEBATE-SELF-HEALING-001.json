Error triggers automatic debate\n2. Agents collaborate to find solution\n3. Solution is implemented AND persisted\n4. System LEARNS and prevents recurrence\n\n## 🌌 INFINITE SOLUTION SPACE PRINCIPLE\n\nThe solution space must be UNBOUNDED. Categories are suggestions, not limits:\n\n### Known Solution Types (Examples, NOT Exhaustive):\n1. **RULE** → Add to Constitution/Config\n2. **FRAMEWORK** → Install open-source tool + write bridge\n3. **TWEAK** → Modify existing config/code\n4. **TOOL** → Write new plugin/adapter\n5. **LESSON** → Document in Knowledge Base for future reference\n6. **PATTERN** → Extract reusable pattern\n7. **GUARD** → Add pre-condition check\n8. **ROLLBACK** → Add undo mechanism\n9. **RETRY** → Add retry with backoff\n10. **DELEGATION** → Assign to human/other agent\n11. **HYBRID** → Combination of above\n12. **NOVEL** → Something we haven't thought of yet\n\n### Key Principle:\n> \"The solution space is infinite. We do not restrict possible solutions.\n> We only require that solutions are: (a) documented, (b) tested, (c) persisted.\"\n\n## 🔧 CURRENT ERROR ANALYSIS\n\n**Error:** MERGE_FAILED - Repository has uncommitted changes\n**Root Cause:** Main repo has 300+ uncommitted files, worktree cannot merge\n**Impact:** Task completed successfully but changes stuck in worktree\n\n### Potential Solutions (for this specific error):\n\n| # | Type | Solution | Complexity |\n|---|------|----------|------------|\n| 1 | GUARD | Check for dirty repo BEFORE task starts | Low |\n| 2 | TWEAK | Auto-stash before merge, pop after | Medium |\n| 3 | RULE | Require clean repo in Constitution | Low |\n| 4 | TOOL | Add \"force-merge\" flag to GitManager | Medium |\n| 5 | PATTERN | Create \"isolated worktree\" pattern (no merge needed) | High |\n| 6 | LESSON | Document in KNOWN_ISSUES.md | Low |\n\n## 📋 REQUESTED ACTIONS FROM AGENTS\n\n### For Gemini-CLI:\n1. Review proposed Self-Healing Protocol\n2. Suggest infrastructure requirements (Redis? SQLite? Both?)\n3. Vote on solution for current MERGE_FAILED error\n\n### For Codex:\n1. Assess implementation complexity\n2. Identify existing code that can be reused\n3. Propose task breakdown\n\n### For All Agents:\n1. Add any solution types I missed\n2. Challenge assumptions\n3. Vote on architectural decisions\n\n## 🗳️ DECISIONS NEEDED\n\n1. **Infinite Solution Space Principle** - Add to Constitution?\n2. **Auto-Debate Trigger** - On which error types?\n3. **Agent Participation** - Redis pub/sub or file-based polling?\n4. **Solution Persistence** - Where to store learned patterns?\n5. **Current Error Fix** - Which solution for MERGE_FAILED?\n\n## 📜 PROPOSED CONSTITUTION AMENDMENT\n\n\n\nAWAITING AGENT RESPONSES.\n",
