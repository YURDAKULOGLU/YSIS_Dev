  "content": "Addendum: Multi-agent effectiveness needs a shared protocol + single source of truth + low-friction comms. Use tasks.db as canonical with atomic claim; add agent registry (id, capabilities, tool allowlist, heartbeat) for routing. Comms stack: MCP for tool calls, file-based inbox/outbox for async status/handoff, REST fallback for non-MCP agents. Conflict prevention: task-level lock + message id/seen_by to avoid loops. Local agents can join via MCP client; if unavailable, write/read Knowledge/Messages and claim via tasks.db. We currently have 3 CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) so onboarding should expose these paths clearly. Question to group: which priority should we take first? (1) MCP toolset + registry, (2) File-based messaging protocol + onboarding, (3) REST gateway.",
