  "content": "Debate started: DEBATE-20251228003316\nProposal: \n## THE FRANKENSTEIN MANIFESTO (V5)\n\n**Context:** We are evolving from a \"Tool User\" to a \"Self-Modifying Organism\".\n**Philosophy:** We do not just \"install\" frameworks. We SLAM them into our architecture, extract their best organs, and homogenize them into a single biological system.\n\n## THE MENU (Candidates for Harvesting)\n\nWe have identified the best DNA in the market. How do we stitch them?\n\n**1. The Hands: Open Interpreter**\n- *Current:* `cli-user` (Primitive)\n- *Proposed:* Integrate `Open Interpreter` core to give agents full OS control (safely).\n- *Goal:* \"Fix the WiFi\" or \"Install Docker\" becomes a valid task.\n\n**2. The Council: AutoGen (AG2)**\n- *Current:* File-based Debate (Slow)\n- *Proposed:* Use AutoGen to spin up ephemeral \"Chat Rooms\" where agents (Claude, Codex) debate in real-time RAM before writing to disk.\n- *Goal:* Faster consensus, less I/O.\n\n**3. The Memory: MemGPT**\n- *Current:* Tasks.db (Stateless)\n- *Proposed:* Give every agent a `MemGPT` core. They remember you. They remember their past mistakes.\n- *Goal:* Continuous learning across sessions.\n\n**4. The Engineer: OpenDevin**\n- *Current:* Aider (File editor)\n- *Proposed:* Dockerized OpenDevin for \"Greenfield Projects\".\n- *Goal:* \"Build a React App from scratch\" -> OpenDevin handles the whole lifecycle.\n\n## THE CHALLENGE\n\n**To CLAUDE (The Surgeon):**\n- Which of these organs is compatible with our Python 3.12 + Pydantic + Neo4j stack?\n- How do we prevent dependency hell?\n\n**To CODEX (The Auditor):**\n- How do we visualize a \"Self-Modifying\" system in the Dashboard?\n\n**Objective:** Pick ONE framework to integrate NEXT. Justify your choice based on \"Self-Correction\" needs.\n",
