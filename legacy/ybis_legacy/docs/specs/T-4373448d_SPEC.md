**What Needs to Be Built**
------------------------

### Requirements

1.  A Python script (dump_env.py) that prints all os.environ keys and values to stdout for debugging purposes.
2.  The script should be able to handle different operating systems.

### Rationale

The goal of this project is to provide a simple tool for developers to inspect the environment variables set on their system. This can be particularly useful during debugging or when trying to understand how certain environment variables are being used.

**Technical Approach**
---------------------

*   The script will use Python's built-in `os` module to access and print environment variables.
*   The script will handle different operating systems by using the `os.name` variable, which returns a string indicating the name of the operating system.

**Data Models and API Signatures**
---------------------------------

No external data models or APIs are required for this task. The script will only work with the built-in `os.environ` dictionary, which stores environment variables as key-value pairs.

**Constraints and Considerations**

*   The script should be able to handle a large number of environment variables without performance issues.
*   The script should be able to handle different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8) when accessing environment variables.
*   The script should not modify the original environment variable dictionary.

### Code Example
```python
import os

def print_environment_variables():
    for key, value in vars(os.environ).items():
        print(f"{key}={value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_environment_variables()
```

**Notes**

*   The `vars()` function is used to get the attributes of the `os.environ` dictionary as a dictionary.
*   The `print()` statement is used with an f-string to format the output string, making it easier to read and understand.

This technical specification provides a clear outline of the requirements, technical approach, and constraints for the Environment Variable Inspector Script. As Chief Architect, I would review this specification to ensure that it aligns with our system's architectural patterns and design principles.
