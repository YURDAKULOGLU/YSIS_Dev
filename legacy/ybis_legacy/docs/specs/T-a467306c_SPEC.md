# Specification: Documenting Exponential Backoff Implementation
======================================================

## Requirements
---------------

* Create a documentation file `docs/RETRY_LOGIC.md` that explains the implementation of exponential backoff in this project.
* The document should provide a clear and concise overview of the backoff mechanism, including any relevant mathematical equations or formulas used.

## Rationale
-------------

The goal of this task is to provide developers with a clear understanding of how exponential backoff is implemented in our system. This will help ensure that the feature is properly maintained and updated over time. By documenting the implementation, we can also improve code readability and reduce technical debt.

## Technical Approach
--------------------

To create the documentation file, we will follow these steps:

1. Review existing code: Study the relevant code snippets responsible for implementing exponential backoff.
2. Break down complex concepts: Simplify complex mathematical equations or formulas into easier-to-understand explanations.
3. Organize content: Structure the document in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.

## Data Models and API Signatures
-------------------------------

No additional data models or API signatures are required for this task, as it is focused solely on documenting an existing implementation.

## Constraints and Considerations
--------------------------------

* The documentation file should be written with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it can be easily read by developers of all skill levels.
* The document should include links to relevant code snippets or GitHub repositories for further reference.
* The content should be concise, clear, and free of technical jargon whenever possible.

## Documentation Guidelines
---------------------------

* Use Markdown formatting and headers to make the document easy to scan.
* Include code snippets and examples as needed to illustrate complex concepts.
* Provide a clear and consistent naming convention throughout the document.

## Deliverables
---------------

The final deliverable will be a well-written, concise, and informative documentation file `docs/RETRY_LOGIC.md` that provides a clear explanation of exponential backoff implementation in this project.
