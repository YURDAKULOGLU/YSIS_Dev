**Technical Specification**
==========================

**Title:** Resolve Syntax Error in `src/ybis/services/currency.py`

**Overview:**
---------------

This technical specification outlines the requirements, rationale, and technical approach for resolving the syntax error in the `src/ybis/services/currency.py` file. The objective is to identify and fix the issue, ensuring the code remains maintainable and adheres to established architectural patterns.

**Requirements:**
-----------------

### Functional Requirements

* Identify and resolve the syntax error in `src/ybis/services/currency.py`
* Verify that the corrected code functions as expected
* Ensure the updated code follows established coding standards and best practices

### Non-Functional Requirements

* Maintainability: Ensure the resolution does not introduce technical debt or complex dependencies
* Scalability: Verify that the fix does not impact performance or system scalability
* Adherence to patterns: Align with established architectural patterns and design principles

**Rationale:**
-----------------

Resolving the syntax error in `src/ybis/services/currency.py` is essential to ensure the overall stability and maintainability of the system. A syntax error can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or crashes, compromising the user experience.

### Technical Approach:
-------------------------

To resolve the syntax error, we will:

1. **Analyze the code**: Carefully examine the `src/ybis/services/currency.py` file to identify the source of the issue.
2. **Apply fixes**: Implement necessary corrections and refactor the code as needed to ensure maintainability and adherence to best practices.
3. **Unit testing**: Verify that the corrected code functions correctly using unit tests.
4. **Code review**: Conduct a thorough review of the updated code to ensure it aligns with established architectural patterns and design principles.

**Data Models and API Signatures:**
-------------------------------------

No data models or API signatures are affected by this task, as the focus is on resolving a syntax error within an existing file.

**Constraints and Considerations:**
--------------------------------------

### System Constraints

* The `src/ybis/services/currency.py` file is part of a larger system with multiple dependencies.
* The team has established coding standards and best practices for Python development.

### Technical Debt

* The solution should not introduce technical debt or complex dependencies that would impact maintainability.

**Design Principles and Patterns:**
--------------------------------------

This task will be evaluated against the following design principles:

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The updated code should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
* **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: The solution should avoid duplicating code or functionality.

### Established Architectural Patterns

* **Modularization**: The updated code will be organized into logical modules to ensure maintainability and scalability.
* **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: The solution will adhere to SoC principles, separating concerns and responsibilities within the codebase.
