# Task Result: Framework Tiers Defined

## Summary
Categorized all system dependencies into three tiers. Infrastructure (Tier 1) changes now mandate a formal Council Debate, ending unilateral structural mutations.

## Changes Made
- Created `docs/governance/FRAMEWORK_TIERS.md`.
- Defined voting requirements for each tier.

## Verification
- Cross-referenced with the current list of organs (LiteLLM, Cognee).
