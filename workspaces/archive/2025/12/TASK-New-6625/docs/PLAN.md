# Task: Framework Tiers & Voting (TASK-GOV-INTAKE-002)

## Objective
To define "Tier 1" frameworks and mandate a Council Debate/Vote before adoption. This ensures that major structural changes have team consensus.

## Approach
Draft `FRAMEWORK_TIERS.md` categorizing dependencies and defining the voting process.

## Steps
1.  Draft `docs/governance/FRAMEWORK_TIERS.md`.
2.  Define Tier 1 (Infrastructure) vs Tier 2 (Tools).
3.  Formalize the "Debate to Decision" workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tiers document exists.
- [ ] Tier 1 adoption requires a Debate ID and a SUCCESS vote.
- [ ] Mandatory artifacts produced.
