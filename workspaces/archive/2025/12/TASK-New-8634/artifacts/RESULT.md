# Task Result: Verification Standards Defined

## Summary
Established mandatory quality gates for all task completions. This ensures that no task can be closed without basic checks like compile, unit tests, and architecture enforcement.

## Changes Made
- Created `docs/governance/VERIFICATION_STANDARDS.md`.
- Added `ruff` to `requirements.txt` to support the new linting gate.

## Verification
- Verified standards against existing automation scripts.
